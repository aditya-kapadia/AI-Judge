"2. The plaintiffs, hereinafter referred to as the appellants, have filed this appeal challenging the final judgment and order dated 2-2-2001 passed by the Bombay High Court Bench at Aurangabad whereby the High Court while allowing the appeal has set aside the judgment and decree passed by the courts below and held the defendant-Respondent 1 as the absolute owner of the entire suit property.
3. One Balwantrao Shinde (who died on 27-6-1954) owned two suit properties, namely, GAT No. 441 (Survey No. 204 admeasuring 2 hectares 27 acres) at Tarsod, Taluka and District Jalgaon, Maharashtra and Gram Panchayat Houses Nos. 2 and 26 at Tarsod, Taluka and District Jalgaon, Maharashtra. Balwantrao Shinde married Anjanabai who died in the year 1940. After her death he married Chhabubai. The plaintiff-appellants are the children from Anjanabai whereas the respondents are Chhabubai and her children. The appellants filed the suit for recovery of half share of the property left by Balwantrao Shinde whereas the respondents claimed ownership of the entire property.
4. The trial court on the pleadings of the parties decreed the suit filed by the plaintiff-appellants to the extent of 11/24th share of the suit property leaving the remaining 13/24th share to the respondents. The respondents being aggrieved filed an appeal. The appellate court while dismissing the appeal filed by the respondents held that the plaintiff-appellants were owners to the extent of entire suit property left by Balwantrao Shinde. The respondents thereafter filed the second appeal in the High Court. The High Courtformulated the following two questions as substantial questions of law arising from the order of the courts below:
?(a) Balwantrao, the husband of Chhabubai (appellant herein Original Defendant 1) had died in the year 1954 before the Hindu Succession Act had come into force. Appellant 1 was in possession of the suit property even before the Hindu Succession Act came into force but after the Hindu Succession Act OriginalDefendant 1 became the absolute owner of the suit property which is in her actual possession, as perSection 14 of the Hindu Succession Act. Even if it is taken for granted that after the death of Balwantrao in 1954, Original Defendant 1 came in possession of the suit property as an alienated owner, her ownership rights had become absolute after the Hindu Succession Act had come into force. Hence are the respondents not entitled to claim any share in the suit property?
(b) Did the lower appellate court have jurisdiction to give relief other than relief sought by the plaintiff because the plaintiff had filed a suit for partition i.e for only half of the portion, of the suit property, therefore, could the District Court have passed an order that the plaintiff became the absolute owner of the entire suit property??
5. On Question 1 it was held that Chhabubai possessed the property left by Balwantrao Shinde in lieu of maintenance and after coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act her right was enlarged to full ownership. Under Question 2 it was held that the appellate court could not grant decree for the entire property in favour of the appellants as the appellants themselves had claimed half portion of the property by way of partition. The judgments of the courts below were accordingly set aside and the suit filed by the appellants was ordered to be dismissed. The defendants were held to be the owners in possession of the entire property.
6. Counsel for the parties have been heard.
7. Counsel for the appellants vehemently argued that in the absence of any pleadings and evidence to the effect that Balwantrao Shinde had given the property to Chhabubai in lieu of maintenance, the High Courthas erred in recording a finding that the property in possession of Chhabubai was in lieu of maintenance which could be enlarged into full ownership rights on her. Counsel for the respondents virtually conceded that Chhabubai did not either raise the plea nor lead any evidence to prove that the properties were given to her by way of maintenance by Balwantrao Shinde. It is also not disputed that properties in the hands of Balwantrao Shinde were ancestral in nature. We agree with the plea raised by the counsel for the appellants that in the absence of any pleadings to the effect that Balwantrao Shinde had given the properties to Chhabubai by way of maintenance and in the absence of any evidence to that effect, the finding that the properties were given in lieu of maintenance to Chhabubai which right could be enlarged into full ownership right could not be recorded. The High Court clearly fell in error in recording a finding to the effect that Chhabubai had become absolute owner of the properties left by Balwantrao Shinde. Another factor which persuades us to take this view is that the properties were ancestral lands of Balwantrao Shinde in which Plaintiff 1 had a right by birth. The entire property therefore could not have been given to Chhabubai by way of maintenance.
8. For the reasons stated above, the findings recorded by the High Court on Question 1 are reversed.
9. We agree with the view taken by the High Court that since the appellants had claimed only half share of the property by way of partition they could not be declared owners to the entire extent of the property. Finding of the High Court on Question 2 is therefore upheld.
10. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the High Court is modified and the appeal is partly allowed. The judgment of the High Court is set aside to the extent indicated above and the decree passed by the trial court is restored. The suit shall stand decreed in terms of the decree passed by the trial court. Parties shall bear their own costs.",1
" 2.Heard learned Adv. Mr. S.M Puranik for the applicants-petitioners, learned APP Mr. C.N Adgokar for respondent no. 1 and learned Adv. Mr. P.S Tiwari for respondent no. 2.
3. Petitioners pray for quashing of Special Case No. 25 of 2010 pending before Additional Sessions Judge, Nagpur.
4. Facts, in brief, are that:-
[a] On 25th August, 2010, respondent no. 2 herein lodged a complaint relating to the incident which had allegedly occurred on or about 11 August, 2008, attracting commission of offence under section 3 (1) (x) of the scheduled castes & scheduled tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act.
[b] Admittedly, petitioners as well as respondent no. 2 are involved in active politics.
[c] Petitioners submitted an application to the Superintendent of Police, stating that the complaint was lodged on account of being instigated by a Member of Legislative Assembly etc., and requested for withdrawal.
[d] After investigation, police filed the charge-sheet and the Special Case is pending in the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Nagpur.
5. Upon impleadment of respondent no. 2, this Court had issued notice to him. Respondent no. 2 has filed reply and supported whatever is pleaded in the petition.
6. To support his contention, learned Adv., for the petitioners has placed reliance on following judgments:-
[a] B.S Joshi v. State of Haryana [AIR 2003 SC 1386], and
[b] Dhananjay Gopalrao Bahergaonkar v. State of Mah. [Criminal Application No. 2505 of 2010; decided on 16 August, 2010 (Coram : A.V Potdar, J. of Bombay High Court, Bench at Aurangabad].
7. After considering the pleadings and rival submissions, this Court is satisfied that though the criminal complaint purportedly of serious nature is filed, and has led to a charge-sheet etc., when the complainant has in unequivocal terms asserted and reiterated even before this Court that the complaint was filed due to being instigated and without actual commission of offence, this Court is convinced that continuing the prosecution any further would turn out to be an empty formality, and would unnecessarily tax the system, apart that ultimately it would lead to acquittal when the every foundation of the case, i.e, complainant's version, does not support the prosecution.
8. The complainant, who has stated on oath before this Court that the complaint was filed due to instigation, cannot be reasonably expected to take a different stand in the Trial Court.
9. Considering status of parties that they are holding responsible political office, and have conceded to the position that the complaint was wrongly filed, interest of justice would be met by allowing this petition and quashing the proceedings in terms of Prayer Clause [a] of the petition.
10. Rule is made absolute in above terms.",1
"2. It was his case that earlier there were contrary decisions on the issue but the Hon'ble Bombay High Court(Bench at Aurangabad), vide order dated 02.12.2014 in the case of CCE, Aurangabad vs. Endurance Technology Pvt. Limited [2015-TIOL-1371-HC-MUM-ST] has framed question No.I as follows:- [I] Whether the CESTAT is correct in holding that the assessee is entitled to avail the CENAVT credit on management, maintenance or repair services provided on services provided to Windmills installed and situated away from factory and factory premises? He further made the Bench go through Para 5 of this judgment to argue that credit on input service regarding maintaining Windmills is allowed by the Hon'ble High Court.
3. Heard both sides and perused the case records. From the Question-I framed by the Hon'ble High Court, it is observed that input services provided in the present appeal were the same as discussed in Para 5 in the case law of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court. Para 5 and 6 of case law CCE vs. Endurance Technology Pvt. Limited (supra) are reproduced below:- 5] On perusal of these Rules, it becomes clear that the management, maintenance and repair of windmills installed by the respondents is input service as defined by clause I of Rule 2. Rule 3 and 4 provide that any input or capital goods received in the factory or any input service received by manufacture of final product would be susceptible to CENVAT credit. Rule does not say that input service received by a manufacturer must be received at the factory premises. The judgments referred to above, also interpret the word input service in similar fashion. In the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Nagpur Versus Ultratech Cement Ltd. [cited supra], the Division Bench of this Court held that the definition of input service is very wide and covers not only services which are directly or indirectly used in or in relation to manufacture of final product but also includes various services used in relation to business of manufacture of final product. The expression activities in relation to business is also discussed in this judgment by referring to judgment of Apex Court. In the case of Deepak Fertilizers & Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd. Versus C.C.Ex. Belapur [cited supra] the Division Bench held as under: The definition of the expression input service covers any services used by the manufacturer, whether directly or indirectly, in or in relation to the manufacture of final products. The words directly or indirectly and in or in relation to are words of width and amplitude. The subordinate legislation has advisedly used a broad and comprehensive expression while defining the expression input service. Rule 2(1) initially provides that input service means any services of the description falling in sub-clauses (i) and (ii). Rule 2 (1) then provides an inclusive definition by enumerating certain specified services. Among those services are services pertaining to the procurement of inputs and inward transportation of inputs. The Tribunal, proceeded to interpret the inclusive part of the definition and held that the Legislature restricted the benefit of Cenvat credit for input services used in respect of inputs only to these two categories viz. for the procurement of inputs and for the inward transportation of inputs. This interpretation which has been placed y the tribunal is ex-facie contrary to the provisions contained in Rule 2 (1). The first part of Rule 2 (1) inter alia covers any services used by the manufacturer directly or indirectly, in or in relation to the manufacture of final products. The inclusive part of the definition enumerates certain specified categories of services. However, it would be farfetched to interpret Rule 2 (1) to mean that only two categories of services in relation to inputs viz. for the procurement of inputs and for the inward transportation of inputs were intended to be brought within the purview of Rule 2 (1). Rule 2 (1) must be read in its entirety. The Tribunal has placed an interpretation which runs contrary to the plain and literal meaning of the works used in Rule 2 (1). Moreover as we have noted earlier, whereas Rule 3(1) allows a manufacturer of final products to take credit of excise duty and Service Tax among others paid on any input or capital goods received in the factory of manufacturer of the final product, insofar as any input service is concerned, the only stipulation is that it should be received by the manufacturer of the final product. This must be read with the broad and comprehensive meaning of the expression input service in Rule 2(1). The input services in the present case were used by the appellant whether directly or indirectly, in or in relation to the manufacture of final products. The appellant, it is undisputed, manufactures dutiable final products and the storage and use of ammonia is an intrinsic part of that process. 6] In view of this discussion, we have no hesitation to hold that the answer to question No. (I) is in affirmative. Despite this settled position, learned counsel for the appellant tried to submit that the judgment cited at Sr. No. (2) is being challenged before Supreme Court. This submission does not really help us in deciding the appeals. Both appeals are dismissed.
4. In view of the above settled proposition of law, appeal filed by the appellant is allowed with consequential relief. (Order dictated and pronounced in the Court) (H.K. Thakur) Member (Technical) .KL",1
"?	I also request you to take action against them and file a case against them and get them punished in accordance with law.
?	I request you to take action against those persons and punish them in accordance with law after filing a case.""
?	It is proposed to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act suitably to deal effectively not only with cases of dowry deaths but also cases of cruelty to married woman by their in-laws.""
?	6. The High Court opined that the words ""paramour"" and ""concubine"" stand on the same footing.
?	(a) The woman must be married; (b) She must be subjected to cruelty or harassment; and (c) Such cruelty or harassment must have been shown either by husband of the woman or by the relative of her husband.
?	If the appellant had not (sic) been instigating the husband of the first informant to torture her, as has been noticed by the High Court, the husband would be committing some offence punishable under the other provisions of the Penal Code and the appellant may be held guilty for abetment of commission of such an offence but not an offence under Section 498-A of the Penal
?	It deserves strict construction.
?	It is now a well-settled principle of law that the more stringent is the law, more strict construction thereof would be necessary.
?	We set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 498-A IPC.""
?	15. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Reema Aggarwal v. Anupam 2004 3 SCC 199 while construing the expression ""husband"" opined that the word should not be given a restricted meaning to include those, who had married for the second time strictly in accordance with law, stating: (SCC p. 210, para 18)
?	19. We may notice that the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rajeti Laxmi v. State of A.P 2007 1 DMC 797 AP held as under: (DMC p. 798, para 4)
?	In the absence of any averment in the charge-sheet or any statement that she is a relative of A-1, I am of the opinion that the offence under Section 498-A IPC does not attract to A-6.
?	The criminal petition is allowed quashing the proceedings in CC No. 233 of 2004 for the offence under Section 498-A IPC, against the petitioner A-6.
?	The charge under Section 498-A IPC cannot be framed and the Metropolitan Magistrate had correctly declined to frame any charges under Section 498-A IPC.""
?	The same has been decided by this Court in Mohit Gupta11 applying the ratio of the Supreme Court decision in Shivcharan Lal Verma.
?	Since the marriage between Rajinder and Meenakshi was a nullity in view of the pendency of Rajinder's divorce proceedings qua his first wife, the offence under Section 498-A, which is specific to 'husband', would not be maintainable the impugned order needs to be corrected on this ground also.""
?	If from the pleadings and evidence the Court finds that the woman concerned is regarded as wife and not as a mere mistress, she can be considered to be a 'wife' and as 'the relative of the husband' for the purpose of Section 498-A IPC. Proof of a legal marriage in the rigid sense as required under civil law is unnecessary for establishing an offence under Section 498-A IPC.
?24. Applying the principles laid down in various decisions referred to above, we have no doubt in our mind, that the appellant is not a relative of the husband of the first informant.

"3. The background facts leading for filing the Writ Petition are as under: It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.6236/2013 (Syed Asad s/o. Syed Yusuf Vs. The State of Maharashtra & others), seeking 7136.2015WP.odt directions to the respondent herein to appoint him on compassionate ground in the place of his father, who died during the course of employment with respondent no.8 College. The said Writ Petition was disposed of by the High Court, thereby giving directions to the respondent management to appoint the petitioner in classIV category on compassionate ground in the light of the scheme of the Department of Education dated 31.12.2002 and also in view of the directives issued by the Joint Director. Accordingly, the petitioner was appointed in ClassIV category on compassionate ground on 18.02.2014. The petitioners proposal seeking approval to his appointment on classIV post was forwarded to the Education Officer by the respondent management. However, the said proposal was not decided by the Education Officer. Therefore, the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.10524/2014 (Syed Asad Syed Yusuf 7136.2015WP.odt Vs. The State of Maharashtra) and in the said Writ Petition the High Court directed Education Officer to consider and decide the proposal on merits. Accordingly, on 26.05.2015 the Education Officer rejected the proposal on the ground that there are 90 surplus teachers and 82 Peons on the role of the Education Officer and in view of the Government Resolution dated 02.05.2012 unless total surplus employees are absorbed, no approval can be granted to the fresh appointment as per the directions given by the State Government. The another ground is given in the impugned communication is that no prior permission of the Education Officer was taken for advertising the post and also for the appointment of the petitioner.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that in fact the management should have appointed the petitioner in respondent no.8 College, 7136.2015WP.odt however, they have appointed the petitioner in another school run by the same management.
5. The learned AGP appearing for the respondent State relying upon the averments made in the affidavitinreply submits that the respondent management does not want to absorb surplus employees, and therefore, instead of appointing the petitioner in respondent no.8 College, the management chose to appoint him in some other school run by the management.
6. The learned counsel appearing for respondent nos.6 to 8 submits that already the proposal is submitted by the management to the Education Officer. The Education Officer has rejected the said proposal on unsustainable grounds. It is submitted that since there was vacancy in another school run by the same management, the petitioner is appointed in another school on the clear 7136.2015WP.odt vacant post. It is submitted that the appointment of the petitioner is in pursuance of the directions issued by the High Court in Writ Petition Nos.6236/2013, and therefore, the appointment of the petitioner, which is made on clear vacant post in the school run by the respondent management is proper.
7. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, learned AGP appearing for respondent nos.1 to 4, learned counsel appearing for respondent no.5 and the learned counsel appearing for respondent nos.
6 to 8. With their able assistance, perused the pleadings in the Petition, grounds taken therein, replies filed by respective respondents. There are two grounds raised by the Education Officer for not according approval to the appointment of the petitioner on classIV post in the school run by the respondent management. Firstly, no prior permission was taken for advertising the post 7136.2015WP.odt on which the petitioner is appointed. In that respect, as it is clear that the Division Bench of the Bombay High CourtBench at Aurangabad in Writ Petition No.6236/2013 (supra) directed the respondent management to give appointment to the petitioner in class IV category on compassionate ground in the light of the scheme of the Department of Education dated 31.12.2002 and the directives issued by the Joint Director within period of four weeks from disposal of the said Writ Petition. The Writ Petition was disposed of on 29.01.2014 and the petitioner was appointed on 18.02.2014. Therefore, the ground that no prior permission was taken by the management or advertisement cannot hold good. Secondly, an appointment on the compassionate ground is given so as to give immediate financial aid / assistance to the family of the deceased employee, who is facing financial crunch / crisis. Therefore, 7136.2015WP.odt in the facts of the present case, as already observed, the High Court after considering the hardship faced by the petitioner and keeping in view the relevant scheme laid down in the Government Resolution dated 31.12.2002 and the directives issued by the Joint Director, directed the respondent management to appoint the petitioner on classIV post. Therefore, in the peculiar facts of this case, the ban imposed by the State Government on fresh recruitment on the ground that there are surplus employees on the role of the State Government, cannot be applied.
8. However, we find considerable force in the arguments of the learned AGP that the petitioner ought to have been appointed on the vacancy available in respondent no.8 College since the petitioners father was working in the said college, and he died during the course of employment. However, now the petitioner is already appointed on 7136.2015WP.odt classIV post in some other school run by the same management. Therefore, the respondent State Government and the Education Officer can strictly apply the said Government Resolution and also the provisions of Section
5 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Condition of Service) Regulation Act and Rules, in case the respondent management wishes to fill up the teaching or non teaching vacant post henceforth.
9. In the light of discussion in the foregoing paragraphs, the impugned communication dated 26.05.2015 is quashed and set aside. The respondents and in particular respondent no.5 is directed to reconsider the proposal for approval to the appointment of the petitioner as ClassIV employee afresh without raising the grounds, which are raised in the impugned communication and take decision on the said proposal, as expeditiously as possible, however, within 7136.2015WP.odt four weeks from receiving copy of the order passed by this Court. However, we make it clear that we have not entered into the exercise of finding out whether the School where the petitioner has been appointed is being run on the grantinaid basis or unaided basis. It is needless to observe that in case the post is on unaided basis, once the approval is granted by the Education Officer, the respondent management will be obliged to pay salary and all other benefits available for the said post, in view of the provisions of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools [Service of Condition] Regulation Act and the Rules.
9. The Petition is partly allowed. Rule is made absolute partly in the above terms. No costs. Sd/- Sd/- [SANGITRAO S.PATIL] [S.S.SHINDE] JUDGE JUDGE",1
"Appa (since deceased) was the brother of A-1 and Chandrakant. In a partition between these three brothers by metes and bounds each one was cultivating the land fallen to his share. Their lands are situated at Village Khudawadi, Taluka Tuljapur in District Osmanabad. There was, however a dispute between Appa and A-1 in respect of the location of foot-track. On 25-9-1987 at about 5.00 p.m, Appa was working in this field whereas his daughter, Sarubai (PW 2) was grazing the cattle nearabout the place of incident. The appellants were also doing their agricultural work in their own land. According to the prosecution the appellants came to the land of Appa and started assaulting him with axes and sickle. Sarubai (PW 2) seeing the assault caused by appellants came near the place of incident and requested them not to assault her father. A-1 and A-2 were assaulting with axes whereas A-3 was assaulting with a sickle. Due to this assault Appa fell down and made a signal to his daughter Sarubai to go to the abadi and call her mother Ambubai (PW 1). Sarubai (PW 2) went to the house but finding that her mother was not there, she left the message with her aunt Muktabai, wife of Chandrakant that she be informed to come to the field with a bullock cart as Appa was assaulted by the appellants. She then came back to the place of incident. Ambubai (PW 1) when returned home from work, Muktabai conveyed the message to her and thereafter she requested Shivaji (PW 4) to get a cart. Shivaji then brought the cart from Maruti and then they reached the place of incident. At that time Appa was bleeding profusely and was unable to speak. Sarubai (PW 2) told her mother that the appellants had assaulted him. Ambubai and Shivaji then put Appa into the cart and left for the dispensary at Naldurg. The doctor on duty declared him dead. Ambubai (PW 1) then went to the police station and lodged the first information report (Ex. 31) at about 10.15 p.m After registering the FIR the investigating officer proceeded to the hospital and thereafter to the place of incident. During the course of investigation, statements of various persons came to be recorded. The accused came to be arrested on 26-9-1987 and in pursuance of their statements the incriminated articles were seized. After completing the investigation the appellants were put up for trial for an offence punishable under Sections 302/34 IPC.
2. The appellants denied the charge and claimed to be tried. According to them they have been falsely implicated in the present crime. They had neither gone to the field of Appa nor they had assaulted him. They pleaded that they are innocent and be acquitted.
3. The prosecution in support of its case principally relied upon the evidence of eyewitness Sarubai (PW 2) (minor) aged about 10 years. Ambubai (PW 1), Shivaji (PW 4) and Shanker (PW 5) were the main witnesses to corroborate the evidence of Sarubai. The prosecution also relied upon the various panchnamas including the panchnamas relating to the recovery of incriminating articles. Dr Onkar Swami (PW 3) performed the autopsy on the dead body of Appa and his report is at Ex. 15. The appellants did not lead any evidence in defence.
4. The learned Sessions Judge, Osmanabad on appraisal of oral and documentary evidence on record by his judgment and order dated 1-7-1988 convicted the first appellant under Section 302 IPC for committing the murder of Appa. Appellants 2 and 3, however were given the benefit of doubt and came to be acquitted. Aggrieved by the judgment and order of conviction and sentence the first appellant Dattu preferred Criminal Appeal No. 352 of 1989 whereas State of Maharashtra preferred Criminal Appeal No. 319 of 1988 challenging the order of acquittal of A-2 and A-3. Both the appeals were heard together and the Division Bench of the High Court by its judgment and order dated 5-9-1990 dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 352 of 1989 and allowed the Criminal Appeal No. 319 of 1988 filed by the State and convicted A-2 and A-3 under Sections 302/34 IPC. It is this judgment and order passed by the High Court which is the subject-matter of challenge in this appeal.
5. The entire prosecution case rested upon the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2) a child witness aged about 10 years. It is, therefore, necessary to find out as to whether her evidence is corroborated from other evidence on record. A child witness if found competent to depose to the facts and reliable one such evidence could be the basis of conviction. In other words even in the absence of oath the evidence of a child witness can be considered under Section 118 of the Evidence Act provided that such witness is able to understand the questions and able to give rational answers thereof. The evidence of a child witness and credibility thereof would depend upon the circumstances of each case. The only precaution which the court should bear in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the witness must be a reliable one and his/her demeanour must be like any other competent witness and there is no likelihood of being tutored. There is no rule or practice that in every case the evidence of such a witness be corroborated before a conviction can be allowed to stand but, however as a rule of prudence the court always finds it desirable to have the corroboration to such evidence from other dependable evidence on record. In the light of this well-settled principle we may proceed to consider the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2).
6. The learned trial Judge recorded his reasons and found that Sarubai was a competent witness and her evidence is unblemished. The High Court also accepted the evidence of Sarubai as a reliable one. We, therefore, do not see any reason to disagree with the observations of the learned courts below as regards the evidence of Sarubai. We were taken through the judgments of the courts below as well as the evidence of Sarubai. She had stated in her evidence that when she was grazing the cattle in the field at about 5.00 p.m, all the three appellants came in her land and started assaulting Appa (her father). A-1 and A-2 had axes in their hands while A-3 was having a sickle in her hand. On seeing a ghastly attack on her father she was very much scared, Appa then made a signal to her to go to the abadi and inform her mother Ambubai (PW 1). She then immediately proceeded towards the abadi and on the way she saw Shanker (PW 5) who was working in his field. After reaching home she found that her mother had not returned from the work and, therefore, left the message with Mukta, the aunt, about the assault on Appa and requested her to ask her mother Ambubai (PW 1) to reach the field with a bullock cart. Sarubai (PW 2) then returned to the place of incident. In the meantime Ambubai (PW 1) who returned from the work got the message and requested Shivaji (PW 4) to get the cart. Shivaji (PW 4) then brought the cart of Maruti in which they reached the place of incident. Sarubai (PW 2) narrated the entire incident to Ambubai (PW 1). Appa was then put in the cart and was taken to the dispensary at Naldurg. The doctor on duty, however declared him dead. We have carefully examined the evidence of this witness and we find that it is totally unblemished. There is no challenge to her evidence that she was in the field at the time of incident. Her evidence finds corroboration from Shanker (PW 5) who had stated that when he was in his field he heard commotion in the field of Appa and after going there he saw Sarubai also in the field. Ambubai (PW 1) in her evidence stated that her daughter Sarubai (PW 2) had gone to the field along with her father and she herself had gone to work in another field. When she returned home in the evening she got a message from Muktabai about the assault and to get a bullock cart in the field. Shivaji (PW 4) has also stated on oath that when he received a message from Ambubai to get a cart he got the same from Maruti and thereafter he and Ambubai went to the field. Sarubai (PW 2) then narrated the incident to her mother. Appa was then taken to the dispensary at Naldurg in the bullock cart where he was declared dead by the Medical Officer. From the evidence of these witnesses it is clear that all these movements took place in a very short span of time because they reached the dispensary at Naldurg which is at a distance of 15 kms, from Khudawadi at about 9.30 p.m or 10.00 p.m We, therefore, see no hesitation in confirming the findings of the courts below that Sarubai was present in the field along with her father at the time of the incident.
7. The second circumstance which lends corroboration to the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2) is that Ambubai (PW 1) in her first information report lodged at 10.15 p.m had given out the names of all the three appellants as assailants of Appa. Although it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2) is concocted and unreliable but we see no substance in this contention. Dr Onkar Swami (PW 3) who held the autopsy on the dead body of Appa noted 16 injuries on the dead body of Appa. He stated that these injuries were possible by three different weapons and not by one weapon. It is needless to set out the evidence of Dr Onkar in detail since there is no challenge to the fact that Appa met with a homicidal death due to injuries on his person. The evidence of Dr Onkar (PW 3) corroborates the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2) when she stated that A-1 and A-2 had assaulted her father with axes and A-3 with a sickle. Out of these 16 injuries as many as 10 were incised wounds and injury 3 was a curved lacerated wound which was attributable to A-3. Having regard to the nature and the size of these injuries we have no manner of doubt that this ghastly attack could not be caused by one person. The High Court in our considered view rightly held that the medical evidence corroborates the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2).
8. In addition to the above substantive evidence the prosecution also relied upon the circumstantial evidence, namely, recovery of certain incriminating articles. The clothes of the accused were seized under panchnama Ex. 55 and this panchnama is proved by panch witnesses Ajmoddin (PW 10). The dhoti and cap of A-1 were sent to the chemical analyser and his report is at Ex. 28, wherein it is stated that the cap had human bloodstains of blood group A which was the same blood group as the deceased. The blood group of A-1 is AB. This independent circumstance again corroborates the evidence of Sarubai (PW 2). The weapons like axes and a sickle were claimed to have been recovered at the instance of the appellants pursuant to the statement made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act but this evidence was not accepted by the trial courtand we do not propose to accept the same.
9. After going through the judgments of the courts below we are satisfied that the High Court was fully justified in reversing the order of acquittal passed by the trial court as regards A-2 and A-3. The High Courtwas also right in upholding the conviction of A-1.
10. In the result there is no substance in the criminal appeal and it is accordingly dismissed. From the office report dated 25-1-1997 it appears that the appellants are in jail and, therefore, no further order in that behalf is called for.",0
"Aggrieved by the concurrent findings and orders passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Aurangabad, and Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Aurangabad (for short he State Commission in Appeal No. 32/2011, the original complainant has filed the present petition purportedly under section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 2. We have heard the petitioner in person. The consumer disputes sought to be raised before the Consumer Fora related to the alleged deficiency in service on the part of the respondents / legal professionals to whom the petitioner had engaged for filing a civil writ petition in the Bombay High Court, Bench at Aurangabad by paying a certain fee. The said writ petition was filed before the said High Court but the counsel sensing the mood of the Bench withdrew the same. According the petitioner / complainant, this action of the counsel was unauthorised and has resulted into prejudice and monetary loss to the petitioner. He would assail the impugned order passed by the Fora below as illegal and not based on correct and proper appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence and material brought on record. We have noted down the above submissions of the petitioner simply to be rejected because, in our view, both the fora below were justified in dismissing the complaint holding that the petitioner / complainant had failed to establish any deficiency in service on the part of the legal professionals in rendering such professional service to the complainant. We are in full agreement with the findings and orders passed by the Fora below and see no merit in the present petition. Dismissed. However, the petitioner would be free to approach the concerned bar council for the alleged mis-conduct of the counsel if he so advised.",0
"2. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay HighCourt, Bench at Aurangabad in Criminal Writ Petition No. 362 of 1998. The High Court has held that when a luxury bus carries passengers excess in number than allowed by the permit, there is a contravention of the terms and conditions of the permit, yet however such contravention does not authorise a police officer to detain and seize the vehicle in exercise of powers under Section 207(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act and, therefore such detention and seizure must be held to be unauthorised and illegal. The said conclusion and the compensation to the tune of Rs 10,000 having been awarded, the State of Maharashtra is in appeal against the same.
3. The association of the owners of the luxury buses in the districts of Nanded and Parbhani, moved the High Court in a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, alleging that the police authorities illegally seized the vehicles of the members of the Association in purported exercise of the powers under Section 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act on the ground that the buses were found to be carrying persons in excess of the number permitted by the authorities in the conditions of permit, though Section 207 does not authorise such detention. It was accordingly prayed to declare such seizure and detention of the vehicles to be illegal and to award compensation. The State and the police authorities filed their returns before the High Court, contending, inter alia, that under Section 207(1) of the Act, the appropriate authority is entitled to seize and detain the vehicle if the vehicle in question is found to have violated any of the conditions of the permit and since the permit itself contemplates a specified number of persons to be carried in the vehicle, the vehicle could be legally seized when it is found to be carrying more than the numbers specified in the permit and, therefore, the seizure and the detention of the vehicle cannot be said to be illegal or unauthorised. The HighCourt by the impugned judgment analysed different provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed thereunder and on consideration of the same, came to the conclusion that it is not each and every violation of the conditions of the permit which would authorise the seizure and detention of the vehicle under Section 207(1) of the Act. On the other hand it is only when the conditions of permit relating to the area, the route or the purpose for which the vehicle is used, are violated, the vehicle could be detained and, therefore, detention or seizure of a vehicle on the allegation that the vehicle was found to be carrying passengers more than the number provided in the permit is not authorised under sub-section (1) of Section 207 of the Act and consequently, such detention being unauthorised, the persons concerned are entitled to compensation.
4. The short question that arises for consideration is whether under sub-section (1) of Section 207 of the Act, the appropriate authority can be said to have the power to detain a vehicle, the vehicle being found to be used in contravention of the conditions of permit relating to the number of passengers which could be carried in the vehicle.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the State vehemently contended that the permit itself having provided for the number of passengers to be carried in the vehicle, when passengers excess in number than allowed for, are found to have been carried in the vehicle, it amounts to contravention of the conditions of permit and, therefore, contravention of the conditions of permit would authorise the appropriate authority to detain the vehicle under Section 207(1) of the Act. According to the learned counsel, the expression ?conditions of permit? used in sub-section (1) of Section 207 should not be given any restrictive meaning, particularly when it is highly dangerous to carry passengers in excess of the number provided for in the permit and if such contravention will not justify detention of the vehicle under Section 207(1), then the power conferred thereunder would be meaningless and, therefore, the court should interpret the provisions conferring such power on the authorities even at the cost of doing violence to the language used in sub-section (1) of Section 207, which would be in the larger public interest.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that the plain grammatical meaning to the words used in sub-section (1) of Section 207 if is ascribed, then it would be apparent that only the conditions of permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which a vehicle is used can be considered for the purpose of ascertaining whether there has been any contravention in respect of the said field and only when it is found that there has been a contravention in the said field, then the power to detain the vehicle under Section 207(1) can be exercised and not otherwise. That being the position, the High Court was fully justified in its conclusion that contravention of the condition of the permit relating to the number of passengers to be carried in the vehicle will not authorise the detention of the vehicle under Section 207(1) of the Act. According to the learned counsel for the respondent the meaning of a statute has to be ascertained from the language used by the legislature and the court need not make a fresh legislation in the field where the meaning is unambiguous and clear from the words used.
7. Section 207(1) of the Act is extracted hereinbelow in extenso:
?207. Power to detain vehicles used without certificate of registration permit, etc.?(1) Any police officer or other person authorised in this behalf by the State Government may, if he has reason to believe that a motor vehicle has been or is being used in contravention of the provisions of Section 3 or Section 4 or Section 39 or without the permit required by sub-section (1) of Section 66 or in contravention of any condition of such permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used, seize and detain the vehicle, in the prescribed manner and for this purpose take or cause to be taken any steps he may consider proper for the temporary safe custody of the vehicle:
Provided that where any such officer or person has reason to believe that a motor vehicle has been or is being used in contravention of Section 3 or Section 4 or without the permit required by sub-section (1) of Section 66 he may, instead of seizing the vehicle, seize the certificate of registration of the vehicle and shall issue an acknowledgment in respect thereof.?
8. The aforesaid power of seizure has been conferred upon the appropriate authority, which power is in fact a sovereign power of the State and has been delegated to the police officer in discharge of their duties of law enforcement and in the enforcement of an orderly society. The power, therefore, is required to be exercised with care and caution and the power has to be exercised only when the precondition for exercise of power is fully satisfied. It is a cardinal principle of the rule of construction of a statute that when the language of a statute is fairly and reasonably clear, then inconvenience or hardships are no considerations for refusing to give effect to that meaning. It is not the contention of the learned counsel appearing for the State nor can it be said that on giving a plain meaning to the words used in Section 207(1) of the Act, there will be any absurdity or it would make the statute offend any provisions of the Constitution. Tindal, C.J in Sussex Peerage case 1844 11 Cl & Fin 85, 143 (Cl&F at p. 143) applying the rule has stated?
?If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves do alone in such cases best declare the intent of the lawgiver.?
9. In Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sarma AIR 1945 PC 48, 53 (AIR at p. 53) Viscount Simonds held:
?[T]his Board has insisted that in construing enacted words, we are not concerned with the policy involved or with the results, injurious or otherwise, which may follow from giving effect to the language used.?
10. In Kanai Lal Sur v. Paramnidhi Sadhukhan AIR 1957 SC 907 (AIR at p. 910) Gajendragadkar, J. as he then was, held:
?If the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such hypothetical construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act.?
11. The intention of the legislature is required to be gathered from the language used and, therefore, a construction, which requires for its support an additional substitution of words or which results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided. Bearing in mind, the aforesaid principles of construction of a statute and on examining the provisions of Section 207 of the Act, which has been quoted earlier, we have no doubt in our mind that the police officer would be authorised to detain a vehicle, if he has reason to believe that the vehicle has been or is being used in contravention of Section 3 or Section 4 or Section 39or without the permit required under sub-section (1) of Section 66 or in contravention of any condition of such permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used. In the case in hand, we are not concerned with the contravention of Section 3 or Section 4 or Section 39 or sub-section (1) of Section 66 but we are only concerned with the question of contravention of the condition of permit. Reading the provisions as it is, the conclusion is irresistible that the condition of permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle could be used if contravened, would only authorise the police officer to detain the vehicle and not each and every condition of permit on being violated or contravened, the police officer would be entitled to detain the vehicle. According to the learned counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra the expression ?purpose for which the vehicle may be used? could be construed to mean that when the vehicle is found to be carrying passengers more than the number prescribed in the permit, the purpose of user is otherwise. We are unable to accede to this contention as in our opinion, the purpose would only refer to a contingency when a vehicle having a permit of a stage carriage is used as a contract carriage or vice versa or where a vehicle having a permit for stage carriage or contract carriage is used as a goods vehicle and vice versa. But carrying passengers more than the number specified in the permit will not be a violation of the purpose for which the permit is granted. If the legislature really wanted to confer power of detention on the police officer for violation of any condition of the permit, then there would not have been the necessity of adding the expression ?relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used?. The user of the aforesaid expression cannot be ignored nor can it be said to be a tautology. We have also seen the form of the permit (Form P.Co.T), meant in respect of a tourist vehicle, which is issued under Rule 72(1)(ix) and Rule 74(6) of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. On seeing the different columns, we are unable to accede to the contention of the learned counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra, that carrying passengers beyond the number mentioned in column 5, indicating the seating capacity, would be a violation of the conditions of permit relating to either the route or the area or the purpose for which the permit is granted. In this view of the matter, we see no infirmity with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court in the impugned judgment and the detention of the vehicles has rightly been held to be unauthorised and consequently, the compensation awarded cannot be said to be without jurisdiction. This appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed but in the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.",0
"The appellant was appointed in the year 1984 with the South Central Railway and was posted at Lalgude Loco-Shed, Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh. On 15.10.1991, one C. M. Reddy, colleague of the appellant, abused him and uttered objectionable words regarding the character of his wife. On this sudden provocation and insinuation, the appellant lost his cool and equanimity and slapped C. M. Reddy. Thereafter, a scuffle ensued, in which Constable Murali of the Railway Police Force had beaten Yard Khalashi Meekwin James, in order to save Constable C.M. Reddy. Meckwin James tried to push them away and consequently they fell down and sustained injuries.

The entire incident happened because of irresponsible behaviour of the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy. It is alleged by the respondents that the entire incident had lowered the reputation of the disciplined Railway Police Force. The departmental enquiry was conducted against them and both of them were found guilty. The punishment of withholding of increment for a period of two years with cumulative effect on Constable C.M. Reddy was imposed and the appellant involved in the same incident, was punished with removal from the service. The punishment of the appellant of removal the from service was maintained even by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, Bench at Aurangabad in Writ Petition No.1673 of 1993 The appellant, aggrieved by the imposition of extreme penalty of removal from the service, has approached this court.

Undoubtedly, the appellant (being a member of a disciplined Force) had acted in a very irresponsible manner. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the conduct of the appellant must be seen in the background of the entire episode. In the departmental enquiry, the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy were found guilty. The penalty of removal of the appellant from the service was maintained even before the Division Bench of the High Court. The appellant aggrieved by the impugned judgment has approached this court.

This Court issued show cause notice to the respondents and in pursuance to that a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Divisional Security Commissioner, Railway Police Force, Hyderabad Division. In para 4 of the said affidavit, it is incorporated that the entire incident was due to the irresponsible behaviour of the appellant and Constable C.M. Reddy. But, in the departmental enquiry, Constable C.M. Reddy was imposed the punishment of withholding of increment for a period of two years with cumulative effect, whereas, the appellant was punished with removal from the service.

We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent, Union of India. On consideration of the peculiar facts and circumstance of this case, the extreme punishment of removal imposed on the appellant seems to be shockingly disproportionate to the level of misconduct on the part of the appellant, particularly when Constable C.M. Reddy, who was involved in the same incident, has been awarded much lesser punishment. The entire incident happened predominantly because of sudden and grave provocation by Constable C.M. Reddy on uttering abusive language and doubting the character of the appellant's wife.

In our considered opinion, the ends of justice would be met if the extreme penalty imposed on the appellant of removal from the service is set aside and, instead, the penalty of withholding of increment for a period of three years with cumulative effect is imposed on the appellant. The appellant shall also not be entitled to any back wages. This appeal is accordingly disposed of. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to bear their own costs.",0
"Petitioner had given following reasons in his application seeking condonation of delay: It is submitted that judgment and order came to be passed by the Learned DCRF on 06.04.2005, it was forwarded by the office of the Learned DCRF on 28.04.2005 which received by the petitioner on or about 19.05.2005. It is submitted that during the period in which impugned order received by the petitioner, one big matter was going on before the Bombay High Court, bench at Aurangabad and entire machinery of the petitioner bank was engaged therein and ultimately the same was required to be filed before the Hon.

Apex Court. The Hon. Apex Court was pleased to issue notices to the respondents therein on or about 05.09.2005 while staying the execution and certified copy of the impugned judgment came to be found. The petitioner obtained the legal opinion and instant appeal is being filed today which is delayed by 128 days. In view of the above, it is submitted that delay in filing instant appeal deserved to be condoned in the interest of justice.

State Commission dismissed the application seeking condonation of delay by recording following reasons: The appellant has received copy of the order on 19.05.2005. The High Court decided the matter in August 2005 and the Supreme Court issued notices in September 2005. The present appeal came to be filed on 28.09.2005. Though, copy was received by the appellant in the second week of May 2005, appeal could not be filed within 30 days. Every matter is important so far as Financial Institute is concerned. The explanation given by the appellant is not at all satisfactorily. No doubt, expression sufficient cause is required to be interpreted liberally. We are aware that in such matters pedantic approach is required to be avoided and pragmatic approach is required to be adopted. In absence of satisfactory explanation, we are not inclined to award a reward to the appellant for gross negligence.

We are therefore not inclined to condone the inordinate delay.

Distinction will have to be made between the delay of few days and the inordinate delay. In case of inordinate delay, rights accrue in favour of opposite party. In the result, we pass following order:.

The delay of 128 days was over and above the statutory period of 30 days for filing the appeal. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 Consumer fora are required to decide the cases in a summary manner within given time frame. Complaint has to be disposed of within 90 days from the date of filing where no expert evidence is required to be taken and within 150 days where expert evidence is required to be taken. The inordinate delay of 128 days could not be condoned without showing sufficient cause. We agree with the view taken by the State Commission that the petitioner was not able to show sufficient cause for condonation of delay.
Petitioner did not explain the delay of each day. The reason given by the petitioner that the file got mixed up with some other files because of which he could not file the appeal, cannot be accepted. Dismissed.",0
"2. A Claim Petition under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act was preferred by the Second Respondent claiming a compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- for the death of her son. The Respondent No. 2 examined ASI Krishan Kumar, P.S Sultanpuri, IO of the case in FIR No. 444/2006 registered in respect of the accident. His testimony regarding involvement of the vehicle (DL-1W-0025) was not challenged in the cross-examination by the Appellant. The Claims Tribunal returned a finding that the accident was caused on account of use of vehicle No. DL-1 W-0025 and awarded the compensation as stated above.

3. A feeble attempt was made by the learned counsel for the Appellant to challenge this finding of fact. However, I do not find any reason to take a view other than the one reached by the Claims Tribunal in view of the IO's unchallenged testimony.

4. It is urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant that there was no breach of the terms of the policy as envisaged under Section 149(2) of the Act and thus the Claims Tribunal erred in granting recovery rights against the Appellant. It is argued that Section 149(2)(a)(i)(c) entitles the insurer to defend the action for payment of compensation if the vehicle was used for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle was being used. The learned counsel urges that the user/driving of the vehicle by a person other than the registered owner cannot be said to be use of the vehicle for a purpose not allowed by the permit. To appreciate the contention raised, it would be appropriate to extract Section 149(2) hereunder:?

?149. Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards against persons insured in respect of third party risks?

(1) ??????????

(2) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub-section (1) in respect of any judgment or award unless, before the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment of award is given the insurer had notice through the Court or, as the case may be, the Claims Tribunal of the bringing of the proceedings, or in respect of such judgment or award so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal; and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds, namely:?

(a) that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy, being one of the following conditions, namely:?

(i) a condition excluding the use of the vehicle?

(a) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward, or

(b) for organized racing and speed testing, or

(c) for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used, where the vehicle is a transport vehicle, or

(emphasis supplied)?

5. I obtained the conditions for grant of a permit for a TSR plying in NCT of Delhi from the transport department, which are also available on the website of the Transport Department, Govt, of National Capital Territory of Delhi. The same are extracted hereunder:?

?1. The vehicles shall ply as per the rate/tariff approved by the Govt./State Transport Authority from time to time and exhibited in the meter.

2. The fare distance chart as per the notified fares duly approved by the State Transport Authority shall be displayed prominently available at the back of the seat of the driver inside the vehicle as prescribed by the State Transport Authority.

3. Only electronic fare meter duly approved and duly calibrated by the Competent Authority or any other metering device duly approved by the competent Authority shall be installed. The Electronic Fare Meter shall be kept in proper working condition.

4. The number of passengers shall not exceed 3 adults excluding driver. A child of not more than 12 years of age shall be reckoned as a half and a child of not more than three years of age shall not be reckoned.
5. The driver shall not refuse to ply any place within the NCT of Delhi or the area specified from time to time.

6. The driver shall not misbehave with the passenger/intending passenger.

7. The driver shall extend help and assistance to all senior citizens and disabled while boarding and alighting the vehicles.

8. The driver shall wear the uniform in grey colour with his/her smart card based Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badge prominently displayed on uniform.

9. The driver shall undergo training as may be prescribed by the Commissioner (Transport) from time to time and in the manner prescribed.

10. The vehicle shall display the Helpline No. of the Transport Department on the rear side of the vehicle also name and address of the permit holder.

11. The vehicle shall affix registration number plate in Braille as per design approved by the Department at the space prescribed by Transport Department.

12. The permit holder shall inform any change in his/her residential address in form 33 of CMVR, 1989 within the stipulated period i.e within 30 days to the Registering Authority.

13. Hire purchase, lease, hypothecation deed shall be allowed for Nationalized Banks. Scheduled Banks and Non-Banking Financial companies duly approved by RBI or any other competent authority notified by Central Govt, in this regard.

14. The permit holder shall exercise such supervision as is necessary to ensure that the vehicle is operated in conformity with the Motor Vehicle Act and the rules made there-under and shall be liable for action for violation of permit condition without prejudice to the action that may be legally permissible to be taken against the driver.

15. The permit holder shall be liable for the suspension/cancellation of the permit for any violation of the permit condition.

16. The vehicle shall be kept neat and clean at all time during the operation.

17. The vehicle must be equipped with the First Aid Box containing material as specified in DMV Rules, 1993.

18. The vehicle must be equipped with the Fire Fighting equipment as specified in DMV Rules, 1993.
19. The drivers identity/particulars along with his/her photograph to be displayed at prominent place inside the wind screen.
20. A complaint book shall be maintained with serial numbers printed and issued by the Transport Department, will be available at the Complaint Box installed at prominent place.

21. The driver must be of good character without any criminal record.

22. The permit holder shall be responsible for the behavior, reliability of the Auto Drivers and to ensure the proper police verification is done.?

6. Thus, a perusal of the condition for issuance of permit, inter alia, are that the vehicle shall be kept neat and clean at the time of operation (condition No. 16); that the vehicle must be equipped with the First Aid Box; that the driver must display the particulars of his identity and photograph at a prominent place inside the windscreen (Condition No. 19); that the driver must be of good character and without any criminal record; the driver shall wear uniform in gray colour with his/her smart card based Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badge prominently displaying on the uniform (Condition No. 8).

7. Can it be said that the Insurance Company would be able to avoid liability if the vehicle is not kept clean or the driver is not wearing the uniform? It is not each and every condition of permit contravention of which would allow the Insurance Company to avoid the liability. On the other hand, a close reading of the Clause (c) to Section 149(2)(i)(a) would show that it is only the user of the transport vehicle for the purpose not allowed by the permit would enable the Insurance Company to defend the action to satisfy an award in a motor accident where the risk is covered by a policy obtained under Section 147 of the Act.

8. The interpretation of contravention of condition of permit envisaged under Section 66 of the Act and the contravention of condition of permit with respect to the purpose for which the vehicle may be used came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in State of Maharastra v. Nanded-Parebhani Z.L.B.M.V Operator Sangh, (2000) 2 SCC 69 albeit in a different context. In the said case, the police had seized certain vehicles for carrying passengers in excess of the numbers permitted by the condition of permit issued by the Transport Authority. The action was challenged by the Association of Transporters by virtue of a writ petition before the Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court. The High Court analyzed the different provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the Rules framed thereunder and on consideration of the same came to the conclusion that it is not each and every violation of the condition of the permit which would authorize the seizure and detention of the vehicle under Section 207(1) of the Act. It was held that it was only when the condition of permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle was used, is violated, the vehicle could be seized by the Authorities. The Appeal filed by the State of Maharastra was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The contention raised on behalf of the State of Maharastra that carrying passengers more than prescribed by the permit could be construed to be violation, was rejected. The Supreme Court relied upon the report in Kanailal Sur v. Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan, (1958) 1 SCR 360 and held as under:?

?If the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the Courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act?. The intention of the legislature is required to be gathered from the language used and, therefore, a construction, which requires for its support with additional substitution of words or which results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided. Bearing in mind, the aforesaid principles of construction of statute and on examining the provisions of Section 207 of the Act, which has been quoted earlier, we have no doubt in our mind that the police officer would be authorised to detain a vehicle, if he has reason to believe that the vehicle has been or is being used in contravention of Section 3 or Section 4 or Section 39 or without the permit required under Sub-section (1) of Section 66 or in contravention of any condition of such permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used. In the case in hand, we are not concerned with the contravention of Section 3 or Section 4 or Section 39 or Sub-section (1) of Section 66 and we are only concerned with the question of contravention of the condition of permit. Reading the provisions as it is, the conclusion is irresistible that the condition of permit relating to the route on which or the area in which or the purpose for which the vehicle could be used if contravened, would only authorise the police officer to detain the vehicle and not each and every condition of permit on being violated or contravened, the police officer would be entitled to detain the vehicle. According to the learned Counsel, appearing for the State of Maharashtra, the expression ?purpose for which the vehicle may be used? could be construed to mean that when the vehicle Is found to be carrying passengers more than the number prescribed in the permit, the purpose of user is otherwise. We are unable to accede to this contention as in our opinion, the purpose would only refer to a contingency when a vehicle having a permit of stage carriage is used as a contract carriage or vice versa or where a vehicle having a permit for stage carriage or contract carriage is used as a goods vehicle and vice versa. But carrying passengers more than the number specified in the permit will not be a violation of the purpose for which the permit is granted. If the legislature really wanted to confer power of detention on the police officer for violation of any condition of the permit, then there would not have been the necessity of adding the expression ?relating to the route on which or the area In which or the purpose for which the vehicle may be used?. The user of the aforesaid expression cannot be ignored nor can it be said to be a tautology. We have also seen the Form of permit (From P.Co T.), meant in respect of a tourist vehicle, which is issued under Rule 72(1)(ix) and Rule 74(6) of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989. On seeing the different columns, we are unable to accede to the contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the State of Maharashtra, that carrying passengers beyond the number mentioned in Column 5, indicating the seating capacity, would be a violation of the conditions of permit relating to either the route or the area or the purpose for which the permit is granted. In this view of the matter, we see no infirmity with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court in the impugned judgment and the detention of the vehicles has rightly been held to be unauthorised and consequently, the compensation awarded cannot be said to be without jurisdiction????

9. Although, the interpretation of Section 207 was done by the Supreme Court in a different context, yet, the same would apply to Clause (c) to Section 149(2)(a)(i) of the Act.

10. Thus, the user of a transport vehicle for the purpose not allowed by the permit would be using a goods vehicle as a passenger vehicle, a passenger vehicle as a goods vehicle, etc. and not each and every contravention of the condition of permit issued by the concerned Transport Authority. Thus, simply because the vehicle was driven by a person other than the permit holder cannot be said to be a user of the transport vehicle for the purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle was used.
11. The Claims Tribunal erred in holding that there was violation of Clause (c) of Section 149(2)(a)(i) of the Act.
12. The impugned order cannot be sustained. The Appeal is accordingly allowed. The impugned order to the extent it grants recovery rights against the Appellant is set aside.

5. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel appearing
4 RAJLW 2007 1 713 3480.2016 Cri.Appln..odt for the applicants, learned APP appearing for respondentState, and the learned counsel appearing for respondent no.3. With their able assistance, we have carefully perused the allegations in the FIR, and the investigation papers made available by the learned APP. It appears that, the accused applicants attended one function in Saffron Hotel. Applicant no.1 Sanjay Kashiram Inche and applicant no.2 Dnyaneshwar Dagaduji Nande attended the said function without invitation, and in that function applicant no.1 and applicant no.2 conducted video shooting / video clips of the said function in their mobile, and on the basis of said video clips stored in their mobile along with other three accused i.e. applicant nos.3 to 5 so as to extract money from respondent no.3 and other Officers decided to visit those Officers, and accordingly, under the fear of causing injury to the reputation of 3480.2016 Cri.Appln..odt respondent no.3, and other Officers demanded money. There are statements of witnesses, who attended the said function in Saffron Hotel at Jalna. Upon perusal of the allegations in the FIR, an alleged offences have been disclosed, and those needs investigation. At this stage, this Court is not supposed to find out the correctness of those allegations. Reliance placed by the learned counsel appearing for the applicants on the observations made by the Supreme Court in the case of Isaac Isanga Musumba [cited supra] is misplaced in the facts of the present case inasmuch as in the present case alleged offences are under Section 385, 500, 501 r/w.
34 of the IPC so as to attract ingredients of Section 385, it is not necessary to mention in the complaint that the amount so demanded is actually delivered to the accused.
6. It further appears from the perusal of the allegations in the FIR that the 3480.2016 Cri.Appln..odtapplicants in order to extract the amount / money from respondent no.3 published news in daily Duniyadari dated 20th June, 2016, and thereby causing injury to the reputation of respondent no.3 by publishing a false allegation. Therefore, in our opinion, no case is made out for quashing the FIR, hence, application stands rejected.
7. The observations made herein before are prima facie in nature and confined to the adjudication of the present application only. This order will not preclude the applicants from applying for discharge in the event of filing chargesheet by the Investigating Officer. [K.K.SONAWANE] [S.S.SHINDE] JUDGE JUDGE",0
