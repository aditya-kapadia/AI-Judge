"?	By the impugned order the High Court has set aside the judgment and decree of the courts below as a result of which the suit filed by the plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred to as ""the appellant"") has been ordered to be dismissed.
?	That the appellant was not entitled to the suit property and was estopped from denying the title of the temple.
?	7. The trial court relying upon the oral as well as documentary evidence held that the appellant was the owner of the property and that Respondent 2 was the tenant of the appellant.
?	The High Court reversed the judgment and decree of the courts below and held that no reliance could be placed upon the documentary evidence.
?	10. All the three questions framed proceed on the assumption as if the property belongs to the temple whereas the findings of the courts below were to the contrary.
?	Instead of proceeding to decide the issues arising in the suit the High Court assumed the second appellate jurisdiction by erroneously assuming the fact that the property belongs to the temple while framing the substantial questions of law.
?	As to whether the appellant or the temple had the title to the property in suit was the question to be determined in the case and the High Court erred in assuming and proceeding on an assumption that the property belonged to the temple.
?	The questions framed by the High Court did not arise as substantial questions of law based on the findings recorded by the courts below - concurrently in this case.
?	The courts of fact, subordinate to the High Court, have not felt the need of any further corroboration before acting upon the entries in the ledger books made by the deceased father of the appellant.
?	The appellant has been believed by the trial court and the first appellate court and his statement has been found to be enough corroboration of the entries made by him.
?	Again no such question of law arose as would enable the High Court to reverse that finding.
?	13. We are definitely of the opinion that the High Court has erred in ruling out the books from consideration on the ground that the same were not duly maintained or were not proved in the absence of the maker having stepped in the witness box.
?	The plaintiff has in his statement deposed and made it clear that the certified copy, though available, was placed on the record of another legal proceedings and in the present proceedings he was tendering the photocopy.
?	It was read by the trial court as also by the first appellate court.
?	Nothing turns on the observation of the High Court that the document was not readable when the matter came up for hearing before it.
?	In the absence of any other lawful claimant the appellant on the strength of the documents produced by him was rightly held to be the owner by the courts below the High Court.
?	The law has been correctly stated and the High Court rightly felt bound to follow the law as laid down by this Court.
?	(Best, ? 95) While civil cases may be proved by a mere preponderance of evidence, in criminal cases the prosecution must prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt.""
?	29. In a suit for recovery of possession based on title it is for the plaintiff to prove his title and satisfy the court that he, in law, is entitled to dispossess the defendant from his possession over the suit property and for the possession to be restored to him.
?	30. In the present case, the trial court and the first appellate court have noted that the plaintiff has not been able to produce any deed of title directly lending support to his claim for title and at the same time the defendant too has no proof of his title much less even an insignia of title.
?	In the opinion of the two courts below, the plaintiff had succeeded in shifting the onus on the defendant and the burden of proof which lay on the plaintiff had stood discharged.
?	The High Court has interfered with a pure and simple finding of fact based on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence which the High Court ought not to have done.
?	The High Court was bound by the findings of fact arrived at by the two courts below and should not have entered into the exercise of reappreciating and evaluating the evidence.
?	The judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and has to be set aside.
?	Judgment and decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the trial court as confirmed by the first appellate court is restored.

"K. Jagannatha Shetty, J.? We grant special leave and proceed to dispose of the appeal.
2. Shobha Rani is the appellant. Her husband is Madhukar Reddi who is respondent before us. The wife is postgraduate in biological sciences. The husband is a medical doctor. They were happily married on December 19, 1982. But their happiness did not last long. They started exchanging letters with bitter feelings. Then they began to accuse each other. At one stage, they thought of winding up by mutual consent. It was perhaps out of disgust. It would have been better, if it had happened. But unfortunately, it did not materialise. Ultimately they landed themselves in the court. The wife moved the court for divorce on the ground of cruelty.
3. Before referring to further facts, let us consider the law. The cruelty simpliciter is now a ground for divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (Act 25 of 1955). Section 13 provides, so far as it is material:
?13. Divorce.?(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party?
(i-a) has, after the solemnization of the marriage, treated the petitioner with cruelty; or?
4. Section 13(1)(i-a) uses the words ?treated the petitioner with cruelty?. The word ?cruelty? has not been defined. Indeed it could not have been defined. It has been used in relation to human conduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct in relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties and obligations. It is a course of conduct of one which is adversely affecting the other. The cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is physical the court will have no problem to determine it. It is a question of fact and degree. If it is mental the problem presents difficulty. First, the enquiry must begin as to the nature of the cruel treatment. Second, the impact of such treatment on the mind of the spouse. Whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse. There may, however, be cases where the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the injurious effect on the other spouse need not be enquired into or considered. In such cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted.
5. It will be necessary to bear in mind that there has been a marked change in the life around us. In matrimonial duties and responsibilities in particular, we find a sea change. They are of varying degrees from house to house or person to person. Therefore, when a spouse makes complaint about the treatment of cruelty by the partner in life or relations, the court should not search for standard in life. A set of facts stigmatised as cruelty in one case may not be so in another case. The cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the type of life the parties are accustomed to or their economic and social conditions. It may also depend upon their culture and human values to which they attach importance. We, the judges and lawyers, therefore, should not import our own notions of life. We may not go in parallel with them. There may be a generation gap between us and the parties. It would be better if we keep aside our customs and manners. It would be also better if we less depend upon precedents. Because as Lord Denning said in Sheldon v. Sheldon 1966 2 All ER 257, 259 ?the categories of cruelty are not closed?. Each case may be different. We deal with the conduct of human beings who are not generally similar. Among the human beings there is no limit to the kind of conduct which may constitute cruelty. New type of cruelty may crop up in any case depending upon the human behaviour, capacity or incapability to tolerate the conduct complained of. Such is the wonderful (sic) realm of cruelty.
6. These preliminary observations are intended to emphasize that the court in matrimonial cases is not concerned with ideals in family life. The court has only to understand the spouses concerned as nature made them, and consider their particular grievance. As Lord Reid observed in Gollins v. Gollins 1963 2 All ER 966, 972:
?In matrimonial affairs we are not dealing with objective standards, it is not a matrimonial offence to fall below the standard of the reasonable man (or the reasonable woman). We are dealing with this man or this woman.?
7. Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) in Dr N.G Dastane v. Mrs S. Dastane. 1975 2 SCC 326, 338 said: (SCC p. 338, para 32)
?The court has to deal, not with an ideal husband and an ideal wife (assuming any such exist) but with the particular man and woman before it. The ideal couple or a near-ideal one will probably have no occasion to go to a matrimonial court for, even if they may not be able to drown their differences, their ideal attitudes may help them overlook or gloss over mutual faults and failures.?
8. With these principles in mind, we may now unfold the story with which the wife came to the court seeking dissolution of her marriage. She made several grievances. We may ignore all but one. The one and the only one with which we are concerned is her complaint about the dowry demand by the husband or his parents. The dowry is a deep-rooted evil in the society. It started as customary presents with love and affection. In olden days, it was customary to give some presents to the bride and bridegroom and his family at the time of marriage. The parents of the bride or their relations out of affection and good intention used to provide the couple something to fall back upon in case of need. The system started at a time when girls were generally not very much educated and even if they were educated they were unwilling to take up gainful employment. There was also less opportunity for them either to supplement the family income or to become financially independent. There was yet another reason for such customary gifts. The daughter then was not entitled to a share in the joint family properties when she had a brother. Hence the father out of affection or other consideration used to give some cash or kind to the daughter at the time of marriage. The right of the father to give a small portion of even the family property as a gift to the daughter at the time of her marriage was recognised. But unfortunately over the years new practice developed. The boy or his family members started demanding cash or kind from the bride's parents. They started demanding dowry as a matter of right. The demand more often extended even after the marriage. There were instances of harassment of the wife, if the demand was not complied with. In order to curb this evil practice, the Parliament enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (Act 28 of 1961). The Act prohibited the giving or taking of dowry. But in spite of this enactment, the pernicious practice continued in some communities. The Joint Committee of Parliament appointed to examine the working of the Dowry Prohibition Act remarked: ?the evil sought to be done away with by the Act, on the other hand, increased by leaps and bounds and has now assumed grotesque and alarming proportions?. Again the Parliament intervened. The Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1984 was enacted with considerable changes in the parent Act. Likewise the Indian Penal Code was amended by introducing an entirely new offence hitherto unknown to criminal jurisprudence. Section 498-A has been introduced in the following terms:
?498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty.?Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.?For the purposes of this section, ?cruelty? means?
(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or
(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.?
9. A new dimension has been given to the concept of cruelty. Explanation to Section 498-A provides that any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive a woman to commit suicide would constitute cruelty. Such wilful conduct which is likely to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical of the woman) would also amount to cruelty. Harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security would also constitute cruelty.
10. We are, however, not concerned with criminal offence either under the Dowry Prohibition Act or under the Indian Penal Code. We are concerned with a matrimonial conduct which constitutes cruelty as a ground for dissolution of marriage. Such cruelty if not admitted requires to be proved on the preponderance of probabilities as in civil cases and not beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. This Court has not accepted the test of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. As said by Chandrachud. J. in Dastane case: (SCC p. 336, para 26) SCR p. 976
Neither Section 10 of the Act which enumerates the grounds on which a petition for judicial separation may be presented nor Section 23 which governs the jurisdiction of the court to pass a decree in any proceeding under the Act requires that the petitioner must prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 23 confers on the court the power to pass a decree if it is ?satisfied? on matters mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of the section. Considering that proceedings under the Act are essentially of a civil nature, the word ?satisfied? must mean ?satisfied on a preponderance of probabilities? and not ?satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt?. Section 23 does not alter the standard of proof in civil cases.
11. Let us now turn to the evidence in this case. It consists of that of wife as PW 1 as against the evidence of husband as RW 1. The parties have also produced the letters exchanged between them. There appears to be no doubt that the husband or his parents were demanding dowry from the appellant. The husband in his letter Ex. A-1 dated 28-8-1983 wrote to the wife:
?Now regarding dowry point, I still feel that there is nothing wrong in my parents asking for few thousand rupees. It is quite a common thing for which my parents are being blamed, as harassment.
12. The wife in her evidence before the court has stated:
?My mother-in-law always used to make demand for money from my parents. I used to tell my parents about what was happening to me in that house. I used to keep silent when my mother-in-law made demands for money. The respondent also sometimes used to make demands for money.
I used to tell him as to why should I ask money from my parents, and I also used to tell him that I would not ask my parents. But he used to reply that such things were only there in olden times and not now and that therefore, I should ask money from my parents. There were fixed deposits receipts in my name in the bank up to one and a half to two lakhs. Besides this there was house plot in my name at Jubilee Hills. I was afraid of telling my husband and my parents-in-law that I would not ask my parents for money. This I was afraid because I had an apprehension that something would be done to me either physically or mentally if I told them so. I entertained this apprehension because this went on regularly every day, that is their demands for money....
I was afraid to go back again to the respondent's house because I felt that the pestering for money will go on like this. I, therefore, developed aversion for going back to the respondent. For that reason, I joined as a school teacher.?
13. The trial court or the High Court did not state that there was no demand for money. The case of the wife was, however, rejected on the ground that there was no satisfactory evidence that the demands were such as to border on harassment. The trial court said:
?Though one would not justify demands for money, it has to be viewed in this perspective. The respondent is a young upcoming doctor. There is nothing strange in his asking his wife to give him money when he is in need of it. There is no satisfactory evidence that the demands were such as to border on harassment.?
14. In regard to the admission by the husband in his letter dated 28-8-1983 as to the dowry demanded by his parents, the trial court observed:
?The letter should be read as a whole. The respondent has an explanation to make and has made one in the cross-examination. He is trying to confess. It is clear from the attitude of the petitioner that she is prone to exaggerate things. That is evident from her complaint of food and the habit of drinking....
Either because of her over-sensitivity or because of her habit of exaggeration, she has made a mountain of molehill. Further, for the reasons best known to her, the petitioner has not examined her father. There is no explanation why he has not been examined in support of her contention that the respondent and his parents were harassing her for money.?
15. The High Court also went on the same lines. The High Court said that the wife appears to be hypersensitive and she imagines too much and too unnatural things. The High Court then observed:
?Though one would not justify demands for money it has to be viewed in the circumstances from a proper angle. The respondent is a doctor, if he asks his rich wife to spare some money, there is nothing wrong or unusual.?
16. This is not a case where the husband requested his wife to give some money for his personal expenses. The High Court appears to have misunderstood the case. It has evidently proceeded on a wrong basis. It proceeded on the ground that the husband wanted some money from his wife for his personal expenses. If the demand was only of such nature we would have thrown this appeal away. The wife must extend all help to husband and so too the husband to wife. They are partners in life. They must equally share happiness and sorrow. They must help each other. One cannot take pleasure at the cost of the other. But the case on hand is not of a failure on that front. It has been admitted by the husband himself in his letter dated August 28, 1983 addressed to the wife that his parents demanded dowry. But he wrote to the wife that there was nothing wrong in that demand of his parents. This is indeed curious. He would not have stated so unless he was party to the demand. The wife has stated in her evidence that there were repeated demands for money from her mother-in-law. Her evidence cannot be brushed aside on the ground that she has not examined her father. It was not the case of the wife that the dowry was demanded directly from her father. The evidence of the father was therefore not material. It is also not proper to discredit the wife as hypersensitive or prone to exaggeration. That would be judging the wife by our style of manners and our standard of life. That we cannot apply. We must try to understand her feelings and then search for the nugget of truth in the entire evidence.
17. The contents of Ex. A-1 should not be read in isolation. It must be viewed against the background of accusations in the letter dated December 26, 1983 written by advocate for the wife to his counterpart. The relevant portion of the letter reads:
?In the background of these, the worst form of ill-treatment that is meted out to our client was constant harassment for monies. It may be brought to your notice that prior to marriage on demand by your client's father a sum of Rs 17,000 was given and also a scooter thereafter. It may be brought to your notice that one other main reason for your client to dowry deaths which are very frequently seen now-a-days in newspapers. It may be pointed out that your client's philosophy is that since our clients are financially sound, there is no wrong for your client's parents to ask for few more thousands. It may be pointed out and brought to your notice that it appears your client's sole object of marriage was to get the monies standing in the name of our client transferred to his name. It would be better to understand that money that stands in our client's name are somewhere about two lakhs. It is not out of place to mention that your client's behaviour and treatment with our client could only be said to be a pointer for seeking these monies alone and marriage was a device.
18. The cumulative effect of all the circumstances and the evidence of parties leads to the conclusion that the demand of dowry went on with the support of the husband. The High Court while dealing with this part of the case has observed that there is no evidence to show that the demands were such as to cause harassment to the wife. The High Court appears to have misconstrued the scope of cruelty in matrimonial affairs. The evidence as to harassment to the wife to meet any unlawful demand for money is necessary to constitute cruelty in criminal law. It is the requirement of the offence of ?cruelty? defined under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act provides that the party has after solemnization of the marriage treated the petitioner with cruelty. What do these words mean? What should be the nature of cruelty? Should it be only intentional, wilful or deliberate? Is it necessary to prove the intention in matrimonial offence ? We think not. We have earlier said that cruelty may be of any kind and any variety. It may be different in different cases. It is in relation to the conduct of parties to a marriage. That conduct which is complained of as cruelty by one spouse may not be so for the other spouse. There may be instances of cruelty by the unintentional but inexcusable conduct of any party. The cruel treatment may also result by the cultural conflict of the spouse. In such cases, even if the act of cruelty is established, the intention to commit suicide cannot be established. The aggrieved party may not get relief. We do not think that that was the intention with which the Parliament enacted Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. The context and the set up in which the word ?cruelty? has been used in the section, seems to us, that intention is not a necessary element in cruelty. That word has to be understood in the ordinary sense of the term in matrimonial affairs. If the intention to harm, harass or hurt could be inferred by the nature of the conduct or brutal act complained of, cruelty could be easily established. But the absence of intention should not make any difference in the case, if by ordinary sense in human affairs, the act complained of could otherwise be regarded as cruelty. The relief to the party cannot be denied on the ground that there has been no deliberate or wilful ill-treatment. The same is also the line of reasoning adopted by the House of Lords in Gollins v. Gollins (at p. 976) where Lord Evershed said:
?I am unable to accept the premise that ?cruelty? in matrimonial proceedings requires or involves of necessity the element of malignity ? though I do not of course doubt that if malignity be in fact established it would be highly relevant to a charge of cruelty. In my opinion, however, the question whether one party to a marriage has been guilty of cruelty to the other or has treated the other with cruelty does not, according to the ordinary sense of the language used by Parliament, involve the presence of malignity (or its equivalent) and if this view be right it follows, as I venture to think, that the presence of intention to injure on the part of the spouse charged or (which is, as I think, the same thing) proof that the conduct of the party charged was ?aimed at? the other spouse is not an essential requisite for cruelty. The question in all such cases is, to my mind, whether the acts or conduct of the party charged were ?cruel? according to the ordinary sense of that word, rather than whether the party charged was himself or herself a cruel man or woman.?
19. Bearing in mind the proper approach to matrimonial offence, we are satisfied that the facts and circumstances brought out by the appellant in this case do justify an inference that there was demand for dowry. The demand for dowry is prohibited under law. That by itself is bad enough. That, in our opinion, amounts to cruelty entitling the wife to get a decree for dissolution of marriage.3
20. In the result, we allow the appeal and in reversal of the judgments of the courts below, we grant a decree for dissolution of the marriage. In the circumstances of the case, however, we make no order as to costs.

"Dr. B.S Chauhan, J.? Leave granted. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 13-2-2009 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in Criminal Misc. No. 4136 of 2003, wherein the first information report (for short ?FIR?) dated 23-7-2002 lodged by the appellant under Sections 420/423/467/468/471/120-B of the Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter called as ?IPC?) has been quashed placing reliance on the decree of the civil court between the same parties in respect of the same subject-matter.
2. The only question for our consideration involved in this appeal is as to whether criminal proceedings can be quashed by the High Court relying upon a finding of the civil court on an issue involved in criminal proceedings in respect of the same subject-matter.
3. The facts and circumstances giving rise to this case are that one Kishori Lal executed an agreement to sell dated 4-1-1988 in favour of Respondents 1 to 4 for land measuring 114 kanals, 2 marlas situate in the revenue estate of Mauza Jadali, Tehsil Khanna, Punjab, at the rate of Rs. 11,000 per bigha. Kishori Lal had received a sum of Rs. 1 lakh as earnest money from the said respondents. The said land had already been mortgaged with the said respondents for Rs. 52,000. As per the terms of the said agreement dated 4-1-1988, the sale deed was to be executed and registered by 10-6-1989.
4. Kishori Lal entered into an agreement to sell dated 22-10-1988 with Kishan Singh, the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants, in respect of the same land at the rate of Rs. 15,300 per bigha and received a sum of Rs. 54,000 as earnest money. As per the said agreement, the sale was to be executed and registered by 15-6-1989.
5. Respondents 1 to 4 filed Suit No. 60 of 1989 against Kishori Lal in the Civil Court, Ludhiana for specific performance and got an interim relief restraining Kishori Lal to alienate the suit land in favour of anyone else by any manner. Shri Kishan Singh, father of the appellants, filed Civil Suit No. 81 of 1996 against Kishori Lal for specific performance on 6-2-1996, however, the suit filed by Respondents 1 to 4 against Kishori Lal was decreed in their favour vide judgment and decree dated 8-5-1996 and in pursuance thereof, the sale has been executed by Kishori Lal in favour of Respondents 1 to 4 on 17-5-1996.
6. Being aggrieved, Kishan Singh, the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants, filed Suit No. 1075 of 1996 seeking cancellation/setting aside of the decree dated 8-5-1996 passed in favour of Respondents 1 to 4. The said civil suit stood dismissed by the civil court vide judgment and decree dated 10-6-2002 against which the appellants have preferred Regular First Appeal (for short ?RFA?) No. 2488 of 2002 before the High Court, which is still pending.
7. Kishan Singh, the predecessor-in-interest of the appellants, filed FIR No. 144 dated 23-7-2002 under Sections 420/423/467/468/120-B IPC at Police Station Division No. 8, Ludhiana alleging forging of the signatures of Kishori Lal on the agreement to sell dated 4-1-1988. The respondents preferred Criminal Misc. No. 4136 of 2003 before the High Court for quashing of FIR No. 144 dated 23-7-2002 and the proceeding subsequent thereto, on the ground that the appellants had lodged it after losing the civil case and with inordinate delay. Findings on factual issues recorded in civil proceedings are binding on criminal proceedings. The High Court, vide its judgment and order dated 13-2-2009, allowed the said application and quashed the FIR on the ground that the appellants could not succeed before the civil court and findings have been recorded by the civil court to the effect that the document i.e agreement to sell was not forged or fabricated. Hence, this appeal.
8. Shri K.T.S Tulsi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants, has submitted that there is no prohibition in law for simultaneously pursuing the civil as well as criminal remedies available in law. Both the proceedings have to take course and be decided according to the evidence adduced therein. Findings of fact recorded by the civil court are not binding on the criminal courts or vice versa. The High Court committed a grave error in quashing the FIR only on the basis of findings of fact recorded by the civil court.
9. Per contra, Shri Abhinav Ramkrishna, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that Kishan Singh filed the FIR at a much belated stage i.e after dismissal of the civil suit by the trial court on 10-6-2002. In case the agreement in their favour provided that the sale deed was to be executed by 15-6-1989, there could be no justification for them to wait and file Suit No. 81 of 1996 for specific performance on 6-2-1996. Thus, FIR has been filed with the inordinate delay of about 14 years and even if it is presumed that they were not aware of the pendency of Suit No. 60 of 1989, Kishan Singh had become fully aware of all the relevant facts at the time of filing Suit No. 1075 of 1996. There is no explanation of delay even after 1996. Thus, the judgment and order of the High Court does not warrant any interference. The appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.
10. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The issue as to whether the findings recorded by a civil court are binding in criminal proceedings between the same parties in respect of the same subject-matter, is no more res integra.
11. In Karam Chand Ganga Prasad v. Union of India AIR 1971 SC 1244 this Court, while dealing with the same issue, held as under: (SCC p. 695, para 4)
?4. ? It is well-established principle of law that the decisions of the civil courts are binding on the criminal courts. The converse is not true.?
12. The said judgment was delivered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court without taking note of the Constitution Bench judgment in M.S Sheriff v. State of Madras AIR 1954 SC 397 on the same issue, wherein this Court has held as under: (AIR p. 399, paras 15-16)
?15. As between the civil and the criminal proceedings we are of the opinion that the criminal matters should be given precedence. There is some difference of opinion in the High Courts of India on this point. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down but we do not consider that the possibility of conflicting decisions in the civiland criminal courts is a relevant consideration. The law envisages such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of one court binding on the other, or even relevant, except for certain limited purposes, such as sentence or damages. The only relevant consideration here is the likelihood of embarrassment.
16. Another factor which weighs with us is that a civil suit often drags on for years and it is undesirable that a criminal prosecution should wait till everybody concerned has forgotten all about the crime. The public interests demand that criminal justice should be swift and sure; that the guilty should be punished while the events are still fresh in the public mind and that the innocent should be absolved as early as is consistent with a fair and impartial trial. Another reason is that it is undesirable to let things slide till memories have grown too dim to trust.
This, however, is not a hard-and-fast rule. Special considerations obtaining in any particular case might make some other course more expedient and just.?
13. In V.M Shah v. State of Maharashtra 1995 5 SCC 767 this Court has held as under: (SCC p. 770, para 11)
?11. As seen that the civil court after full-dressed trial recorded the finding that the appellant had not come into possession through the Company but had independent tenancy rights from the principal landlord and, therefore, the decree for eviction was negatived. Until that finding is duly considered by the appellate court after weighing the evidence afresh and if it so warranted reversed, the findings bind the parties. The findings, recorded by the criminal court, stand superseded by the findings recorded by the civil court. Thereby, the findings of the civil court get precedence over the findings recorded by the trial court, in particular, in summary trial for offences like Section 630. The mere pendency of the appeal does not have the effect of suspending the operation of the decree of the trial court and neither the finding of the civil court gets disturbed nor the decree becomes inoperative.?
14. The correctness of the aforesaid judgment in V.M Shah was doubted by this Court and the case was referred to a larger Bench in K.G Premshanker v. Inspector of Police AIR 2002 SC 3372. In the said case, the judgment in V.M Shah was not approved. While deciding the case, this Court placed reliance upon the judgment of the Privy Council in King Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad AIR 1945 PC 18 wherein it has been held as under: (IA p. 212)
?? It is conceded that the findings in a civil proceeding are not binding in a subsequent prosecution founded [upon] the same or similar allegations. Moreover, the police investigation was stopped, and it cannot be said with certainty that no more information could be obtained. But even if it were not, it is the duty of a criminal court when a prosecution for a crime takes place before it to form its own view and not to reach its conclusion by reference to any previous decision which is not binding [upon] it.?
(emphasis added)
15*. In P. Swaroopa Rani v. M. Hari Narayana Alias Hari Babu AIR 2008 SC 1884 this Court has held as under: (SCC pp. 769-71, paras 11, 13 & 18)
?11. It is, however, well settled that in a given case, civil proceedings and criminal proceedings can proceed simultaneously. Whether civil proceedings or criminal proceedings shall be stayed depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. ?
13. Filing of an independent criminal proceeding, although initiated in terms of some observations made by the civil court, is not barred under any statute. ?
18. It goes without saying that the respondent shall be at liberty to take recourse to such a remedy which is available to him in law. We have interfered with the impugned order only because in law simultaneous proceedings of a civil and a criminal case are permissible.?
16**. In Iqbal Singh Marwah v. Meenakshi Marwah 2005 4 SCC 370 this Court held as under: (SCC pp. 389-90, para 32)
?32. Coming to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid conflict of findings between the civil and criminal courts, it is necessary to point out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings is entirely different. Civil cases are decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence while in a criminal case the entire burden lies on the prosecution and proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given. There is neither any statutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one proceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both the cases have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein.?
17. In Syed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam v. State (Delhi Admn.) 2009 5 SCC 528 this Court considered all the earlier judgments on the issue and held that while deciding the case in Karam Chand, this Court failed to take note of the Constitution Bench judgment in M.S Sheriff and, therefore, it remains per incuriam and does not lay down the correct law. A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Vishnu Dutt Sharma v. Daya Sapra (Smt). 2009 13 SCC 729, wherein it has been held by this Court that the decision in Karam Chand stood overruled in K.G Premshanker.
18. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the issue stands crystallised to the effect that the findings of fact recorded by the civil court do not have any bearing so far as the criminal case is concerned and vice versa. Standard of proof is different in civil and criminal cases. In civil cases it is preponderance of probabilities while in criminal cases it is proof beyond reasonable doubt. There is neither any statutory nor any legal principle that findings recorded by the court either in civil or criminal proceedings shall be binding between the same parties while dealing with the same subject-matter and both the cases have to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein. However, there may be cases where the provisions of Sections 41 to 43 of the Evidence Act, 1872, dealing with the relevance of previous judgments in subsequent casesmay be taken into consideration.
19. In view of the above, the judgment and order of the High Court dated 13-2-2009 is not sustainable in the eye of the law and is liable to be set aside. However, the facts and circumstances of the case do not warrant so.
20. The agreement to sell in favour of the appellants' father is dated 22-10-1988 and the sale deed was to be executed and registered by 15-6-1989. Respondents 1 to 4 filed Civil Suit No. 60/1989 in 1989. It is difficult to believe that the appellants' father was not aware of the pendency of that suit. No explanation has been furnished as to why after expiry of the date of execution of the sale deed in favour of Kishan Singh i.e 15-6-1989, the appellants' father did not file the suit for specific performance which was subsequently filed on 6-2-1996 as Civil Suit No. 81 of 1996. Even if it is presumed that Kishan Singh was not aware of pendency of the suit filed by Respondents 1 to 4, no explanation could be furnished that in case the appellants' father filed another Suit No. 1075 of 1996 for setting aside the decree dated 8-5-1996 in Civil Suit No. 60 of 1989, why did he wait till the decision of that suit for lodging FIR, as the civil and criminal proceedings could have proceeded simultaneously. The FIR has been filed only on 23-7-2002 i.e after filing RFA No. 2488 of 2002 before the High Court on 15-7-2002. Therefore, there is an inordinate delay on the part of the appellants' father in filing the FIR and there is no explanation whatsoever for the same.
21. Prompt and early reporting of the occurrence by the informant with all its vivid details gives an assurance regarding truth of its version. In case there is some delay in filing the FIR, the complainant must give explanation for the same. Undoubtedly, delay in lodging the FIR does not make the complainant's case improbable when such delay is properly explained. However, deliberate delay in lodging the complaint is always fatal. (Vide Sahib Singh v. State Of Haryana. AIR 1997 SC 3247.)
22. In cases where there is a delay in lodging an FIR, the court has to look for a plausible explanation for such delay. In the absence of such an explanation, the delay may be fatal. The reason for quashing such proceedings may not be merely that the allegations were an afterthought or had given a coloured version of events. In such cases the court should carefully examine the facts before it for the reason that a frustrated litigant who failed to succeed before the civil court may initiate criminal proceedings just to harass the other side with mala fide intentions or the ulterior motive of wreaking vengeance on the other party. Chagrined and frustrated litigants should not be permitted to give vent to their frustrations by cheaply invoking the jurisdiction of the criminal court. The court proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment and persecution. In such a case, where an FIR is lodged clearly with a view to spite the other party because of a private and personal grudge and to enmesh the other party in long and arduous criminal proceedings, the court may take a view that it amounts to an abuse of the process of law in the facts and circumstances of the case. (Vide Chandrapal Singh v. Maharaj Singh AIR 1982 SC 1238; State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal AIR 1992 SC 604; G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P AIR 2000 SC 754; and Gorige Pentaiah v. State of A.P 2008 12 SCC 531)
23. The case before us relates to a question of the genuineness of the agreement to sell dated 4-1-1988. The said agreement was between Kishori Lal and the respondents and according to the terms of the said agreement, the sale deed was to be executed by 10-6-1989. As the sale deed was not executed within the said time, suit for specific performance was filed by the other party in 1989 which was decreed in 1996.
24. So far as the present appellants are concerned, agreement to sell dated 22-10-1988 was executed in favour of their father and the sale deed was to be executed by 15-6-1989. No action was taken till 1996 for non-execution of the sale deed. The appellants' father approached the court after 7 years by filing Suit No. 81 of 1996 for specific performance. However, by that time, the suit filed by the present respondents stood decreed. The appellants' father filed another Suit No. 1075 of 1996 for setting aside the judgment and decree passed in favour of Respondents 1 to 4. The said suit was dismissed by the Additional District Judge (Senior Division), Khanna on 10-6-2002. Subsequently, the appellants preferred RFA No. 2488 of 2002 on 15-7-2002 against the aforesaid order, and the said appeal is still pending before the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
25. It is to be noted that the appellants' father Kishan Singh lodged FIR No. 144/02 on 23-7-2002 through his attorney Jaswant Singh Mann under Sections 420/323/467/468/471/120-B IPC, against the respondents. The allegations made in the FIR were substantially similar to the allegations made by the appellants in Civil Suit No. 1075 of 1996, which had been decided against them. It is evident that the aforesaid FIR was filed with inordinate delay and there has been no plausible explanation for the same. The appellants lodged the aforesaid FIR only after meeting their Waterloo in the civil court. Thus, it is evident that the FIR was lodged with the sole intention of harassing the respondents and enmeshing them in long and arduous criminal proceedings. We are of the view that such an action on the part of the appellants' father would not be bona fide, and the criminal proceedings initiated by him against the respondents amount to an abuse of the process of law.
26. In view of the above, and to do substantial justice, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondents in spite of the fact that the impugned judgment dated 13-2-2009 passed in Criminal Misc. No. 4136 of 2003 is not sustainable in the eye of the law.
27. With these observations, the appeal stands disposed of.

Civil cases are to be decided on the basis of preponderance of probabilities of evidence, whereas criminal cases are to be decided on the basis of proving the guilt beyond reasonable doubts. In view of ratio of laid down in Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr vs. Meenakshi Marwah and Anr. (2005) 4 SCC 370, both civil and criminal cases can go simultaneously.

2. The appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court whereby the appellants' prayer for quashing proceedings in CC No. 3532 of 2001 on the file of the Court of XVIIIth Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai, by exercise of powers under section 482 of the code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ?the Code?) was rejected. Background facts sans unnecessary details are as follows:
Respondent 2 as the complainant filed a complaint in the Court of the Magistrate concerned alleging commission of offences punishable under Sections 498-A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ?IPC?) and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in short ?the Dowry Act?). The Magistrate directed the police to investigate and after investigation charge-sheet was filed by the police. When the matter stood thus, the appellants filed an application under section 482 of the code before the High Court alleging that the Magistrate concerned has no jurisdiction even to entertain the complaint even if the allegations contained therein are accepted in toto. According to them, no part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court concerned. The complaint itself disclosed that after 15-4-1997, the respondent left Nagercoil and came to Chennai and was staying there. All the allegations which are per se without any basis took place according to the complainant at Nagercoil, and therefore, the courts at Chennai did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. It was further submitted that earlier a complaint was lodged by the complainant before the police officials concerned having jurisdiction; but after inquiry no action was deemed necessary.
3. In response, learned counsel submitted that some of the offences were continuing offences. Appellant 1 had initiated proceedings for judicial separation, the notice for which was received by her at Chennai and, therefore, the cause of action existed.
4. The High Court unfortunately did not consider rival stands and even did not record any finding on the question of law raised regarding lack of jurisdiction. It felt that legal parameters were to be considered after a thorough trial and after due opportunity to the parties and, therefore, the factual points raised by parties were not to be adjudicated under section 482 of the code.
5. In support of the appeal Mr T.L Vishwanath Iyer, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous. A bare reading of the complaint would go to show that no part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court where the complaint was filed. Therefore, the entire proceedings had no foundation.
6. In response, learned counsel for Respondent 2 complainant submitted that the offences were continuing in terms of Section 178(c) of the Code, and, therefore, the court had the jurisdiction to deal with the matter.
7. section 177 of the code deals with the ordinary place of inquiry and trial, and reads as follows:
?177. Ordinary place of inquiry and trial.?Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.?
8. Sections 177 to 186 deal with venue and place of trial. Section 177 reiterates the well-established common-law rule referred to in Halsbury's Laws of England (Vol. 9, para 83) that the proper and ordinary venue for the trial of a crime is the area of jurisdiction in which, on the evidence, the facts occur and which are alleged to constitute the crime. There are several exceptions to this general rule and some of them are, so far as the present case is concerned, indicated in section 178 of the code which reads as follows:
?178. Place of inquiry or trial.?(a) When it is uncertain in which of several local areas an offence was committed, or
(b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another, or
(c) where an offence is continuing one, and continues to be committed in more local areas than one, or
(d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas,
it may be inquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.?
9. ?All crime is local, the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed?, as observed by Blackstone. A significant word used in section 177 of the code is ?ordinarily?. Use of the word indicates that the provision is a general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Code. As observed by the Court in Purushottamdas Dalmia v. State Of West Bengal. AIR 1961 SC 1589, L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras. AIR 1961 SC 1601, Banwarilal Jhunjhunwala v. Union of India AIR 1963 SC 1620 and Mohan Baitha v. State of Bihar 2001 4 SCC 350 exception implied by the word ?ordinarily? need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on consideration or may be implied from the provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same court. No such exception is applicable to the case at hand.
10. As observed by this Court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi AIR 1973 SC 908 a continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all, that it is one of those offences which arises out of the failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, liability continues till compliance, that on every occasion such disobedience or non-compliance occurs or recurs, there is the offence committed.
11. A similar plea relating to continuance of the offence was examined by this Court in Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee 1997 5 SCC 30. There the allegations related to commission of alleged offences punishable under sections 498-a, 506 and 323 ipc. On the factual background, it was noted that though the dowry demands were made earlier, the husband of the complainant went to the place where the complainant was residing and had assaulted her. This Court held in that factual background that clause (c) of Section 178 was attracted. But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband on 15-4-1997 on account of alleged dowry demands by the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai. That being so, the logic of Section 178(c) of the Code relating to continuance of the offences cannot be applied.
12. The crucial question is whether any part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court concerned. In terms of section 177 of the code, it is the place where the offence was committed. In essence it is the cause of action for initiation of the proceedings against the accused.
13. While in civil cases, normally the expression ?cause of action? is used, in criminal cases as stated in section 177 of the code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed. These variations in etymological expression do not really make the position different. The expression ?cause of action? is, therefore, not a stranger to criminal cases.
14. It is settled law that cause of action consists of a bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law applicable to them, gives the allegedly affected party a right to claim relief against the opponent. It must include some act done by the latter since in the absence of such an act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would arise.
15. The expression ?cause of action? has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense cause of action means the circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for the action. In the wider sense, it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the proceeding including not only the alleged infraction, but also the infraction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously, the expression means every fact, which it would be necessary for the complainant to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right or grievance to the judgment of the court. Every fact, which is necessary to be proved, as distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is necessary to prove such fact, comprises in ?cause of action?.
16. The expression ?cause of action? has sometimes been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which constitute either the infringement or the basis of a right and no more. In a wider and more comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote the whole bundle of material facts.
17. The expression ?cause of action? is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for sitting; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. In Black's Law Dictionary a ?cause of action? is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which, if traversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In Words and Phrases (4th Edn.), the meaning attributed to the phrase ?cause of action? in common legal parlance is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf.
18. In Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn.) it has been stated as follows:
? ?Cause of action? has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation, the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. ?Cause of action? has also been taken to mean that a particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject-matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action.?
19. When the aforesaid legal principles are applied, to the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint petition, the inevitable conclusion is that no part of cause of action arose in Chennai and, therefore, the Magistrate concerned had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The proceedings are quashed. The complaint be returned to Respondent 2 who, if she so chooses, may file the same in the appropriate court to be dealt with in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

"R.S Pathak, J.? This appeal by special leave and the four associated special leave petitions question the dismissal by the High Court of Allahabad of five revision petitions filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on the ground that they are not maintainable.
2. Although the five cases before us must be considered in the context of their individual facts, it is desirable to appreciate the relevant jurisdictional structure of revisional power enjoyed by the High Court from time to time. In 1970, the provisions of Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure read:
?115. Revision.?The High Court may call for the record of any case which has been decided by any court subordinate to such High Court, and in which no appeal lies, thereto, and if such subordinate court appears?
(a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or
(b) to have exercised a jurisdiction so vested, or
(c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity,
the High Court may make such order in the case as it thinks fit.?
3. A schematic analysis of the judicial hierarchy within a State indicates that the High Court, as the Apex Court in the hierarchy, has been entrusted, not only with the supreme appellate power exercised within the State but also, by virtue of Section 115, the power to remove, in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice, any jurisdictional error committed by a subordinate court in those cases where the error cannot be corrected by resort to its appellate jurisdiction. The two salient features of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 are, on the one hand, the closely limited grounds on which the court is permitted to interfere and on the other, the wide expanse of discretion available to the court, when it decides to interfere, in making an appropriate order. The intent is that so serious an error as one of jurisdiction, if committed by a subordinate court, should not remain uncorrected, and should be removed and the record healed of the infirmity by an order shaped to reinstate the proceeding within the proper jurisdictional confines of the subordinate court. It is a power of superintendence, and fittingly it has been conferred in terms enabling the High Court to exercise it, not only when moved by an aggrieved person, but also suo motu. While considering the nature and scope of the revisional jurisdiction, it is necessary however, to advert to the prime circumstance that in civil cases the jurisdiction has been entrusted to the highest Court of the State, demonstrating that broadly the order under Section 115 is to be regarded, in the absence of anything else, as a final order within the State judiciary.
4. From its inception there was increasing resort to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115. Over the years the Vol. of litigation reached an insupportable point in the pending docket of the court. To alleviate the burden, a pattern of decentralisation of revisional power was adopted and Section 115 was amended by successive State amendments, each attempting to close the gap left by its predecessor. In its meandering course from stage to stage, this is how Section 115 read:
?1. from april 8, 1970:
By virtue of Section 3, U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1970, Section 115 was amended and the result was that:
(i) The High Court had exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 in a case arising out of an original suit of the value of Rs 20,000 and above; and
(ii) The High Court and the District Court had jurisdiction under Section 115 concurrently in other cases.
2. From september 20, 1972:
Section 6, U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1972 amended Section 115 further with effect from September 20, 1972. Later, Section 115 was amended by Section 2, U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1973 in its application to Uttar Pradesh, retrospectively with effect from September 20, 1972. In consequence:
(i) The High Court possessed exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 in cases arising out of original suits of the value of Rs 20,000 and above, including such suits instituted before September 20, 1972;
(ii) The District Court possessed exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 in any other case, including a case arising out of an original suit instituted before September 20, 1972:
Provided that in respect of cases decided before September 20, 1972 and also all cases arising out of original suits of any valuation, decided by the District Court, the High Court alone was competent to exercise revisional power under Section 115.
Section 2(e), U.P President's Acts (Re-enactment with Modifications) Act, 1974 repealed the U.P CivilLaws (Amendment) Act, 1973, and re-enacted it with certain modifications which, however, for the purposes of the present case are immaterial.
3. From February 1, 1977:
Section 43, Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 was enacted by Parliament and it amended Section 115 with effect from February 1, 1977 making substantial changes therein. Section 97(1) of the Amendment Act provided that any amendment made, or provision inserted, in the Code of Civil Procedure by a State Legislature before February 1, 1977 would stand repealed except insofar as such amendment or provision was consistent with the Code as amended by the said Amendment Act. As the Code now amended provided for revisional jurisdiction in the High Court alone, the scheme embodied in Section 115 by the successive U.P Amendment Acts was plainly inconsistent with the Code as now amended, and therefore stood repealed, the position reverting to what it was under the original Section 115 before its amendment by the U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1970. But Section 97(2)(o) provided that Section 115 as now amended by the Amendment Act, 1976 would not apply to nor affect any proceeding for revision which had been admitted, after preliminary hearing, before February 1, 1977 and every such proceeding for revision would be disposed of as if Section 43 had not come into force. The proviso was without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of Section 6, General clauses Act, 1897. In the result:
(i) The High Court had exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 in a revision petition filed on and after that date, irrespective of the valuation of the suit out of which the case arose;
(ii) A revision petition under Section 115 which had been admitted, after preliminary hearing, before February 1, 1977 would continue to be governed by Section 115 as it stood before that date.
4. From August 1, 1978:
Finally, Section 3, Code of Civil Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1978, which was deemed to have come into force on August 1, 1978, amended Section 115 again and restored the bifurcation of revisional jurisdiction between the High Court and the District Court. Accordingly now:
(i) The High Court alone has jurisdiction under Section 115 in cases arising out of original suits or other proceedings of the value of Rs 20,000 and above, including such suits or other proceedings instituted before August 1, 1978;
(ii) The District Court alone has jurisdiction under Section 115 in any other case, including a case arising out of an original suit or other proceedings instituted before August 1, 1978;
(iii) The High Court has jurisdiction under Section 115 in respect of cases, arising out of original suits or other proceedings of any valuation, decided by the District Court.
(iv) A revision proceeding pending immediately before August 1, 1978 of the nature in which a District Court could exercise revisional power under Section 115 as amended by the Amendment Act, 1978 if pending?
(a) in the District Court, would be decided by that court as if the Amendment Act of 1978 were in force at all material times;
(b) in the High Court, would be decided by the High Court as if the Amendment Act of 1978 had not come into force.?
5. The submissions made by learned counsel before us cover a wide field, but in the main, two questions arise:
?(1) Whether the High Court possesses revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of CivilProcedure in respect of an order of the District Court under Section 115 disposing of a revision petition??
(2) Whether the High Court possesses revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 against an order of the District Court under Section 25, Provincial Small Cause Courts Act disposing of a revision petition?
6. As regards the first question, it will be noticed that a revisional power was formerly entrusted exclusively to the highest court in the State, the High Court. The State amendments now divided it between the High Court and the District Court. The amendment effected by the U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1970conferred exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 in the High Court in cases arising out of original suits of the value of Rs 20,000 and above, and in other cases the revisional jurisdiction was concurrently shared between the High Court and the District Court. It was apparently supposed that the average litigant would prefer the less expensive and more convenient forum of the District Court. The measure, it seems, did not bring the relief expected, and the State Legislature found it necessary, by enacting the U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1972 to make a clear-cut division of jurisdiction between the High Court and the District Court, resulting in exclusive revisional jurisdiction to the High Court in cases arising out of original suits of the value of Rs 20,000 and above, and exclusive jurisdiction under Section 115 to the District Court in other cases. There was a sharp bifurcation of revisional jurisdiction, and the High Court and District Court now enjoyed mutually exclusive revisional powers. A controversy arose whether a revisional order under Section 115 made by the District Court was final or was itself amenable to the revisional power of the High Court under the same section. The point was considered by a Full Bench of the High Court in Har Prasad Singh v. Ram Swarup AIR 1973 All 390, and it was held that no such revision petition was maintainable before the High Court. Further State amendments were made to Section 115 without materially disturbing the division of power. But a proviso added to Section 115 by the U.P Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1973, followed by the U.P President's Acts (Re-enactment with Modifications) Act, 1974 stated:
?Provided that in respect of cases decided before the day of September 20, 1972, and also all cases arising out of original suits of any valuation decided by the District Court, the High Court alone shall be competent to make an order under this section.?
The proviso reopened the controversy whether a revision petition lay to the High Court against a revisional order passed by the District Court, and on a difference of opinion between two learned Judges a third learned Judge of the Allahabad High Court now held in Phool Wati v. Gur Sahai AIR 1975 All 262 that a revision petition would lie.
7. The Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, however, superseded the scheme of bifurcation of revisional jurisdiction with effect from February 1, 1977, and, with certain modifications, the position reverted to what it was under the original Section 115. In other words, the entire sphere of revisional jurisdiction was restored to the High Court, no such power being now vested in the District Court. An exception was made where a revision petition under Section 115 had been admitted, after preliminary hearing, before February 1, 1977; it would continue to be governed by Section 115 as it stood before that date. The situation lasted only briefly, for on August 1, 1978 the Code of Civil Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1978 substantially restored the status quo ante.
8. The controversy whether it is open to the High Court to exercise revisional power in respect of a revisional order under Section 115 of the District Court presents little difficulty. The basis for determining that question flows from the principle incorporated in the bifurcation of the revisional jurisdiction. And legislative history comes to our aid. The consistent object behind the successive amendments was to divide the workload of revision petitions between the High Court and the District Court and decentralise that jurisdiction. That purpose was sought to be achieved by classifying all cases into two mutually exclusive categories depending on the valuation of the suit out of which they arose. In determining whether the legislature intended a further revision petition to the High Court, regard must be had to the principle that the construction given to a statute should be such as would advance the object of the legislation and suppress the mischief sought to be cured by it. It seems to us that to recognise a revisional power in the High Court over a revisional order passed by the District Judge would plainly defeat the object of the legislative scheme. The intent behind the bifurcation of jurisdiction ? to reduce the number of revision petitions filed in the High Court ? would be frustrated. The scheme would, in large measure lose its meaning. If a revision petition is permitted to the High Court against the revisional order of the District Court arising out of a suit of a value less than Rs 20,000 a fundamental contradiction would be allowed to invade and destroy the division of revisional power between the High Court and the District Court, for the High Court would then enjoy jurisdictional power in respect of an order arising out of a suit of a valuation below Rs 20,000. That was never intended at all.
9. In Phool Wati considerable importance was attached to the proviso introduced in Section 115 by the U.P Civil Laws Amendment Act, 1973. The proviso declared that ?in respect of ... all cases arising out of original suits of any valuation decided by the District Court, the High Court alone shall be competent to make an order under this section?. What it said was that no matter what the valuation of the original suit, be it Rs 20,000 and above or below Rs 20,000, if a case arising out of such suit was decided by the District Court, the case would be amenable to the revisional power of the High Court. We are already familiar with the category of cases where the High Court wields revisional jurisdiction over cases arising out of original suits of a value of Rs 20,000 or more. That is the category already covered by the substantive provision in section 115. The other category covered by the proviso would include those instances, for example, where an original suit, although of a value making it triable by a court subordinate, is transferred to the District Court for trial. Orders passed by the District Court in such a suit could constitute a case decided by it, and amenable to the revisional power of the High Court. What must be noted is that the test incorporated in the proviso is the fact that the case has been decided by the District Court. The valuation of the suit is irrelevant. But the proviso cannot be construed to include the case of a revisional order passed by the District Court, for that would be in direct conflict with the fundamental structure itself of Section 115 evidencing that a mutually exclusive jurisdiction has been assigned to the High Court and the District Court within its terms. A proviso cannot be permitted by construction to defeat the basic intent expressed in the substantive provision. Har Prasad Singh and Phool Wati3 were considered by a Full Bench of the High Court in Jupiter Fund (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Dwarka Diesh Dayal and, in our judgment, the High Court rightly laid down there that the phrase ?case arising out of an original suit? occurring in Section 115 does not cover orders passed in revision.
10. We are of opinion on the first question that the High Court is not vested with revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, over a revisional order made by the District Court under that section.
11. We shall now advert to the second question, whether a revisional order of the District Court under Section 25, Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, is amenable to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 Code of Civil Procedure. Section 25 originally provided:
?25. The High Court, for the purpose of satisfying itself that a decree or order made in any case decided by a court of Small Causes was according to law, may call for the case and pass such order with respect thereto as it thinks fit.?
Section 25 was amended in its application to the State of Uttar Pradesh from time to time. The first amendment substituted the District Judge for the High Court, so that the District Judge became the repository of revisional power instead of the High Court. A further amendment, made in 1972, added a proviso, which declared that in relation to any case decided by a District Judge or Additional District Judge exercising the jurisdiction of a Judge of Small Causes, the power of revision under Section 25 would vest in the High Court.
12. The question before us arises in those cases only where the District Judge has exercised revisional power under Section 25. Is an order so made open to revision by the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure? An examination of the several provisions of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act indicates that it is a self-sufficient Code so far as the present enquiry is concerned. For the purpose of correcting decrees or orders made by a court of Small Causes the Act provides for an appeal and a revision in cases falling under Section 24 and Section 25 respectively. Cases in which the District Judge and the High Court respectively exercise revisional power are specifically mentioned. A complete set of superior remedies has been incorporated in the Act. Moreover, Section 27 of the Act provides:
?27. Finality of decrees and orders.? Save as provided by this Act, a decree or order made under the foregoing provisions of this Act by a court of Small Causes shall be final.?
The legislature clearly intended that a decree or order made by a court of Small Causes should be final subject only to correction by the remedies provided under the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act. It is a point for consideration that had Section 25, in its application to the State of Uttar Pradesh, continued in its original form the High Court would have exercised the revisional power under Section 25, and no question could have arisen of invoking the revisional power of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code. All the indications point to the conclusion that a case falling within the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act was never intended to be subject to the remedies provided by the Code of Civil Procedure. By way of abundant caution,Section 7 of the Code made express provision barring the application of Sections 96 to 112 and 115 of the Code to courts constituted under the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act. Section 7 of the Codemerely embodies the general principle against resort to remedies outside the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act. Although the court of the District Judge is not a court constituted under the Act, the general principle continues to take effect. No change in the principle was brought about merely because revisional power under Section 25, before the proviso was added, was now entrusted to the District Judge. It must be remembered that the legislative intention behind the amendment was to relieve the High Court of the burden of exercising revisional jurisdiction in respect of cases decided under the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act.We are of firm opinion that the central principle continues to hold, notwithstanding the amendment effected in Section 25, that the hierarchy of remedies enacted in the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act represents a complete and final order of remedies, and it is not possible to proceed outside the Act to avail of a superior remedy provided by another statute.
13. These considerations were apparently not present before the High Court of Allahabad when it held in Bimla Rani Kohli v. Bandu Motor Finance (P) Ltd.4 that a revisional order of the District Judge under Section 25, Provincial Small Cause Courts Act could be revised by the High Court, under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In our opinion, the view taken by the High Court is not correct.
14. Accordingly, we hold that an order passed under Section 25, Provincial Small Cause Courts Act by a District Court is not amenable to the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
15. In Civil Appeal 2844 of 1979, SLP 9104 of 1979, SLP 9142 of 1979 and SLP 9752 of 1979, the High Court has rejected revision petitions filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the revisional orders of the District Court under Section 25, Provincial Small Cause Courts Act. On the opinion reached by us that a revision petition under Section 115 is not maintainable against a revisional order under Section 25, the appeal and the associated special leave petitions must be dismissed.
16. special leave Petition 9031 of 1979 arises out of an application for an ad interim injunction made in a pending suit. Since then the suit has been dismissed, and an appeal against the decree is pending. As the suit itself has been disposed of, all proceedings for grant of interim relief must be regarded as having lapsed. The special leave petition has become infructuous and must be dismissed accordingly.
17. It has been urged by the appellant in Vishesh Kumar v. Shanti Prasad No. 2844 of 1979) that in case this Court is of the opinion that a revision petition under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is not maintainable, the case should be remitted to the High Court for consideration as a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. We are unable to accept that prayer. A revision petition under Section 115 is a separate and distinct proceeding from a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, and one cannot be identified with the other.
18. In the result, the appeal and the special leave petitions are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.

"?	3. The appeals arise from the common judgment of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 2646 of 1990 and batch.
?	214 examinees who were otherwise to fail would pass, and the remaining 69 examinees have improved their ranking, which would be in some cases exceptionally good.
?	Several writ petitions were filed in the High Court against non-declaration of the results and the High Court directed to take expeditious action to declare the results of the examination within the specified time.
?	The finding that tampering was done at the instance of the examinees/parents/guardians is perverse.
?	The impugned notification dated August 31, 1990 was quashed.
?	6. The first question is whether the Standing Committee of the concerned Divisional Board has power under the Act and Regulations to enquire into the use of unfair means committed at the final examination conducted under the Act.
?	When the Divisional Board is conducting the examinations and dealing with the use of unfair means at the final examination, it is acting on behalf of the State Board as its agent.
?	When the Education Standing Committee takes the decision its decision is on behalf of the Divisional Board to which they are members and the decision of the Divisional Board in turn is on behalf of the State Board.
?	The government retired the respondent compulsorily which was challenged in a writ petition.
?	A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court held that the District Judge cannot be retired from service on the opinion formed by the Administrative Committee and all the Judges should have considered and made recommendation.
?	The order was set aside.
?	On appeal, the Constitution Bench of this Court held that Article 235 of the Constitution provides control over the District Judges and the court subordinate thereto shall be vested in the High Court.
?	The High Court regulated the manner of appointment of a Committee to screen the service record.
?	The rules framed prescribed the manner in which the power has to be exercised.
?	The High Court held that the Samiti was vested with power to grant licence to hold the fair under Section 117 of West Bengal Panchayat Act, 1973.
?	The resolution of the Samiti was upheld.
?	It was quashed.
?	The facts were that while the appellant was working as the District and Sessions Judge, the State Government moved the High Court for his premature retirement.
?	The Board must be deemed to have passed the impugned notification as per the scheme of the provisions of the Act and the Regulations.
?	The finding of the learned Judge Sugla, J. that the Standing Committee had no power to take the impugned decision, etc. without approval of the Divisional Board is clearly illegal and cannot be sustained.
?	The question emerges whether the conclusion reached by the Standing Committee that the fabrication was done at the behest of either the candidate or the parents or the guardians to their advantage is based on records.
?	We remind ourselves that while exercising the powers, under Article 226 or Article 136 of the Constitution, by the High Court or of this Court, we are not sitting as a court of appeal on the findings of facts recorded by the Standing Committee (domestic enquiry body), nor have power to evaluate the evidence as an appellate court and to come to its own conclusions.
?	If the conclusions reached by the Board can be fairly supported by the evidence on record then the High Court or this Court has to uphold the decision, though as appellate court of facts, may be inclined to take a different view.
?	No evidence was placed on record, nor was it proved; that the findings of the Standing Committee are clearly based on no evidence.
?	The learned Judges of the High Court were justified in reaching the conclusion that the Board had not established that the fabrication was done at the behest of the examinees/parents/guardians.
?	The inference from these facts drawn by the Standing Committee that the examinees/parents/guardians were responsible to fabricate the moderators' mark sheets is based on evidence.
?	Thereby the High Court has committed manifest error of law warranting interference by this Court.
?	Education should be co-related to the social, political or economic needs of our developing nation fostering secular values breaking the barriers of casteism, linguism, religious bigotry and it should act as an instrument of social change.
?	What the writ court needs to do is to find whether fair and reasonable opportunity has been given to the students in the given facts.
?	The omission to provide the assistance of a counsel at the inquiry is not violative of the principles of natural justice.
?	The Enquiry Reports are not bad in law.
?	It also aids the appellate or revisional authority or the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 or the appellate jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 to see whether the authority concerned acted fairly and justly to mete out justice to the aggrieved person.
?	There is no need to examine the concerned officials in the State Board to explain as to how and who dealt with the papers from the time recounting was done in the office till the moderators' mark sheets were sent to Pune to feed the computer.
?	For the reasons given earlier, the argument stands rejected.
?	The impugned notification is not vitiated by violation of the rules of natural justice.
?	25. The crucial question is whether the conclusions reached by the authorities that the examinees, their parents or guardians were parties to the fabrication and whether their complicity was established from record and whether the evidence was sufficient to support such conclusion reached by the Standing Committee or the Enquiry Officer.
?	The High Court held that the findings of the Committee were based on no evidence and quashed the cancellation of the results.
?	It was held that it would amount to the adoption of unfair means.
?	The High Court committed error in assuming that there is no evidence in proof of it.
?	It was held that the appeal was allowed and the order of the High Court was set aside and that of the domestic tribunal was confirmed.
?	The ratio therein is inapplicable to a proceeding either in the civil case or in an enquiry before a domestic tribunal.
?	The reviewing court will require to be satisfied that the facts which are required for the justification of the restraint put on liberty do exist.
?	The flexibility of the civil standard of proof suffices to ensure that the court will require the high degree of probability which is appropriate to what is at stake.
?	The civil standard of flexibility be applied to deal with immigration cases.
?	It was held that the student did not deny commission of the offence it was held that the student suffered no injustice by reason of the breach of the rules.
?	The Court noted that the Chief Minister was not prepared, as suggested by the Division Bench, to face an inquiry and that substituted to the findings of the Division Bench, in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment that the court would be cognizant of the steep decline of public standards, public moral and public morale which have been contaminating the social environment and emphasised that (SCC p. 253, para 51) ""where such situations cry out the courts should not and cannot remain mute and dumb"" and it is necessary to cleanse public life.
?	When an inference of proof that a fact in dispute has been held established there must be some material facts or circumstances on record from which such an inference could be drawn. Go to
?	It is clear that the conclusion reached by the Education Standing Committee that the fabrication was done at the instance of either the examinees or their parents or guardians is amply borne out from the record.
?	The Court under Article 136 has to correct the illegalities committed by the High Court when it exceeded its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 226.
?	43. The appeals are allowed but in the circumstances parties are directed to bear their own costs.

"?	The suit was dismissed by a judgment dated 18-1-1982 by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi.
?	Against the concurrent findings of both the judgments, the appellants filed Special Leave Petition No. 3740 of 2001 in this Court which was also dismissed on 16-3-2001.
?	8. The defendants in the suit contended that inasmuch as Regular First Appeal (Original Side) No. 4 of 1982 was still pending Ram Parshad's suit be stayed under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
?	The suit filed by Ram Parshad for mandatory injunction and for mesne profits stood revived on 5-12-2001.
?	Against the order, Civil Miscellaneous (Main) No. 1153 of 2004 was filed in the High Court which was disposed of on 2-9-2004 with liberty to move an application before the trial court for framing an additional issue.
?	Order 20 Rule 5 clearly states that the court has to return finding on each issue.
?	Sub-rule (2) refers to the discretion given to the court where the court may try an issue relating to the jurisdiction of the court or the bar to the suit created by any law for the time being in force as preliminary issue.
?	16. Aggrieved by the order dated 23-10-2009, the defendants (the appellants herein) preferred Civil Revision Petition No. 76 of 2010 in the High Court of Delhi.
?	At the preliminary hearing, the petition was allowed to be withdrawn, leaving the trial court at liberty to consider the request of the appellants to treat Issue 4 regarding court fee as a preliminary issue.
?	The matter is at the stage of final arguments before the trial court.
?	Applications after applications are being filed by the appellants at every stage, even though orders of the trial court are based on sound reasoning.
?	The appellants tried to mislead the court by mentioning wrong date of 22-9-2003 as the date of filing.
?	21. The High Court has also dealt with a number of judgments dealing with the power of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution.
?	On pleadings, Issue 4 was framed with regard to court fee and jurisdiction.

?	Court to pronounce judgment on all issues.-(1) Notwithstanding that a case may be disposed of on a preliminary issue, the court shall, subject to the provisions of sub-rule (2), pronounce judgment on all issues.""
?	Neither does it relate to the bar created by any law nor the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit.
?	It is well settled that frivolous litigation clogs the wheels of justice making it difficult for courts to provide easy and speedy justice to the genuine litigations.

?	16-4-2002-As the value of the suit is below Rs 3 lakhs, the suit is transferred to the Court of the Civil Judge.
?	33. According to Dr. Mohan, in our legal system, uncalled for litigation gets encouragement because our courts do not impose realistic costs.
?	Our courts are flooded with these cases because there is an inherent profit for the wrongdoers in our system.
?	Pragmatic approach of the courts would partly solve the housing problem of this country.
?	42. In the instant case when the entire question of title has been determined by the High Court and the special leave petition against that judgment has been dismissed by this Court, thereafter the trial court ought not to have framed such an issue on a point which has been finally determined up to this Court.
?	In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation.
?	It is a matter of common experience that court's otherwise scarce and valuable time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of uncalled for cases.
?	The better course for the court is to give a short notice and in some cases even dasti notice, hear both the parties and then pass suitable bipartite orders.
?	As a rule, the court should grant interim injunction or stay order only after hearing the defendants or the respondents and in case the court has to grant ex parte injunction in exceptional cases then while granting injunction it must record in the order that if the suit is eventually dismissed, the plaintiff or the petitioner will have to pay full restitution, actual or realistic costs and mesne profits.
?	In Swaran Singh v. State of Punjab 2000 5 SCC 668 this Court was constrained to observe that perjury has become a way of life in our courts.
?	The courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.
?	The court must adopt realistic and pragmatic approach in granting mesne profits.
?	The court must carefully keep in view the ground realities while granting mesne profits.
?	53. According to us, these aforementioned steps may help the courts to drastically improve the existing system of administration of civil litigation in our courts.
?	55. The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how long the defendants or respondents were compelled to contest and defend the litigation in various courts. Go to
?	The appellants in the instant case have harassed the respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts.
?	The appeals are dismissed with costs, which we quantify as Rs 2,00,000 (Rupees two lakhs only).
?	57. The suit pending before the trial court is at the final stage of the arguments the said suit is directed to be disposed of as expeditiously as possible and in any event within three months from the date of the communication of the order as we have not decided the matter on merits of the case.
?	59. the appeals are disposed of in terms of the aforementioned directions.

"Sir Arther Channell:-
The respondent in this case was plaintiff in an action against the appellant company in the Superior Court of Quebec to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him when travelling in a tramcar of the appellants' by a collision with another tramcar of the same company. The action was tried before a special jury, who gave a verdict for the plaintiff for 12,000 dollars on 12th December, 1912 and judgment was given for the plaintiff for that amount. The appellants on 10th January 1913, took proceedings to have the judgment set aside on the ground that the jury had not been duly constituted and was without jurisdiction, and also that one of the jurors was relative to and was connected by affinity with the plaintiff and was not indifferent between the parties and also that in the course of the trial communications in reference to the case passed between the plaintiff his relatives and those who were conducting his case and that juror and other jurors. At the trial there had been no challenge either to the array or to any individual juror.
These proceedings ultimately failed, and by a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting as Court of review in Montreal, the judgment in favour of the plaintiff was upheld. From the judgment of the Court of Review this appeal is brought. The questions argued before the Board were whether, on the grounds alleged or either of them, the judgment at the trial ought to have been set aside, and whether the procedure taken for setting it aside was correct in form. There are also proceedings taken to set aside the verdict and judgment on the ground that the damages were excessive ; but these are standing over pending the decision of this appeal. What the appellants did on 10th, January 1913, was to present a petition in revocation of judgment known in Quebec as a requete civile which came on to be heard before Beaudin J. on 27th January who held without going into the evidence, that requete civile was not the proper way to raise the question. An appeal from this decision was taken to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) which Court, by a majority, on 30th October 1913, allowed the appeal, ordered the reception of the petition and remitted the record to the Superior Court for proof and hearing of the issues contained in the petition. This proof and hearing took place on 21st November 1914, when the judge (Monet J.) heard the evidence and dismissed the petition on the merits. He also disallowed a demurrer by the respondent to the petition, following, in so doing, the judgment of the King's Bench (Appeal side). The appellants appealed to the Court of Review from the decision of Monet, J. disallowing his requete civile, but the respondent did not appeal from the disallowance of his demurrer. The Court of Review affirmed the judgment of Monet, J. but a majority of the judges were of opinion that the proceedings were wrong in form and should have been dismissed on that ground as well as on the merits. The most important question on the appeal to this Board is as to the effect of serious irregularities in the preliminary proceedings for constituting the jury panel. On this point Monet J. found that irregularities or breaches of the provisions of law had occurred but that the appellants could not avail themselves of them because they had not proved any prejudice to have been suffered by them in consequence.
Very elaborate and minute enactments are contained in the Revised Statutes of Quebec (Arts. 3409, 3411, 3414, 3416, 3418, 3421, 3423, 3426, 3427, 3428, 3429 and 3462) for the constitution of a revising board to revise annually the jury lists, there being one list of grand and another of petit juries.
The municipalities are directed to give notice to the sheriff of new names of qualified persons and of the deaths, removals or exemptions of those on the old lists. The board of which the sheriff is a member and apparently president, sit in private to make their revision, but public notice is given before the lists are sent on to the sheriff. There are detailed provisions as to the mode of revision, as to initialling alterations and additions and as to the times of various steps and other matters. The lists so revised serve for criminal and possibly other purposes, and from the list of grand jurors the list for trial of civil cases is made. The sheriff by Art. 3429, immediately after the revision of the list, is to notify the prothonotary, who is then to correct his list. The prothonotary's duties are prescribed by Art. 430 and following sections of the Quebec Code of Civil procedure. He is bound to make alist of the persons qualified to serve as Jurors in Civil cases by taking from the list of persons qualified to serve as grand jurors in criminal cases which is deposited in his office the names of all persons residing within fifteen miles of his office in the order in which such names appear and he is to revise his list immediately after receiving notice from the sheriff that he has completed the revision of the grand jury list. Then when an order is made for the trial of a civil cause by a jury, the names are taken in order from the list to form a panel for that case, and proceedings are taken for reducing the number for trial of the cause which appear similar to what is known in this country as striking a jury under the old practice, still permissible by special order.
On the hearing of the requete civile before Monet, J., it was proved that in the year 1912, when the cause was tried, these provisions had for several years been neglected by the sheriff. There had been no revision at all, and old lists had been used. So far as the prothonotary was concerned, it is not clear that he in any way neglected his duties, inasmuch as he used ""the list deposited in his office"" of grand jurors although that was, of course, an old one, not duly revised by the sheriff and board. From that prothonotary's list the names for this jury were duly taken in order. The statutes contain no enactment as to what is to be the consequence of non-observance of these provisions. It is contended for the appellants that the consequence is that the trial was coram non judice and must be treated as a nullity.
It is necessary to consider the principles which have been adopted in construing statutes of this character and the authorities so far as there are any on the particular question arising here. The question whether provisions in a statute are directory or imperative has very frequently arisen in this country, but it has been said that no general rule can be laid down, and that in every case the object of the statutes must be looked at. The cases on the subject will be found collected in Maxwell on Statutes, 5th. ed. p. 596 and following pages. When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done. This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale P. C. p. 50 Rex v. Leicester Justices [1827] 7 B. and C. 6, and Parke B in Gwynne v. Burnell, [1835] 2 Bing. N.C. 7, to provisions as to rates (Reg., v. Inhabitants of Fordham [1839] 11. Ad. and. E. 73, and Le Feuvre v. Millar [1857] 26 L. J. (M. C.) 175; to provisions of the Ballot. Act Woodward v. Sarsons [1875] L. R. 10. C. P. 733, and Philips v. Goff [1886] 17. Q. B. D. 805, and to justices acting without having taken the prescribed oath, whose acts are not held invalid (Margate Pier Co. v. Hannam [1819] 3 B. and A1. 266. In the case now before the Board it would cause the greatest public inconvenience if it were held that neglect to observe the provisions of the statute made the verdicts of all juries taken from the list ipso facto null and void so that no jury trials could be held until a, duly revised list had been prepared. As to the objects sought to be attained by these elaborate provisions for the mode of preparing the lists, there seem to be three things aimed at: first to distribute the burden of jury service equally between all liable to it; secondly to secure for the use of the Courts effective lists of jurors likely to attend when called, the names of dead men and absent or exempted men being left out; thirdly, to prevent the selection of particular individuals for any jury, commonly called; packing. The duties imposed on the sheriff appear intended for the first and second of these purposes, and those of the prothonotary for all the three. His duty to take the names in rotation prevents packing, and his taking the names next after those who last served distributes the burden. In this case the prothonotary had a list in fact, although an old one, and the men on it had all been qualified, and probably in most cases remained so. The names were taken in proper rotation and those ultimately sworn appear all to have been qualified. As to some of the matters, such as the omission to initial correct alterations, it would be impossible to hold that these made the whole list null and void. Having regard to the nature of the sheriff's duties and their object, it seems quite unnecessary and wrong to hold that the neglect of them makes the list null and void; and although the prothonotary's neglect, if it had been in the matter of the order of taking the names, might have resulted in a packed jury, the neglect, if there had been any in other matters, would be of the same kind as the sheriffs. It does far less harm to allow cases tried by a jury formed as this one was, with the opportunities there would be to object to any unqualified man called into the box, to stand good than to hold the proceedings null and void. So to hold would not, of course, prevent the Courts granting new trials in cases where there was reason to think that a fair trial had not been had. The view taken by Monet, J. that he ought not to interfere where the appellants had shown no prejudice appears very reasonable, and their Lordships are of opinion that it is also in accordance with the authorities. Taking first the Canadian cases to which counsel referred. The case most relied on was Grose v. Holmes Electric Protection Co. Q. R. 9, S. C. 374. In that case the facts are to be gathered from the judgment which is set out in full in the report and it seems that there had been somewhat similar neglect by the sheriff in his duties as to jury lists as in the present case; but the prothonotary also had in direct breach of the Code, omitted names standing next in order and taken others lower down. This amounted to a process of packing the jury, and might possibly have been done with that intention. The minor breaches such as want of initials, are recited in the judgment, but the facts as a whole clearly show prejudice to use Monet, J.'s phrase, and show the very mischief to have happened which, it was one of the objects of the statute to prevent. That a challenge to the array was allowed in that case is quite consistent with Monet J's. decision. Rex v. Mc Crae Q. R. 16 K. B. 193, also quoted, was a case of murder and after a verdict of guilty the conviction was quashed on grounds going to the merits, but it was also held by a majority of the Court that the swearing and inclusion in the jury of a person assigned by mistake, but whose name was not written in the panel of jurors, and who had not the qualifications required by law for being one of the jury is illegal and a verdict returned by a jury so composed is null and should be quashed. This seems to have little to do with the matter, as here no juror is shown to have been disqualified, and if one had been, probably Monet J., would have held it to be ""prejudice"". The difference of opinion amongst the judges in that case arose from the different views taken as to certain sections of the Criminal Code which have no application to the case now before the Board. McKay v. Glasgow and London Insurance Co. 32 Lower Canada Jurist, 125, also quoted, merely shows that if a juror is, in fact, interested and has not been challenged his interest not being known until after the trial, a new trial will be granted, which obviously has no bearing on the point now under consideration. Of the English cases, Mulcahy v. Reg. L. R. 3 H L. 306, was a writ of error on a criminal conviction taken to the House of Lords. The trial had taken place in one year under a commission opened in the previous year. There were lists of jurors duly made out according to the provisions of the statutes relating to the matter for each of the two years. The jury had been taken from the list for the first of the two years and it was argued that it should have been taken from the list for the year in which the trial took place. The judges were summoned, and questions put to them in the usual way and Willes J. delivered the opinion of the judges to the effect that the right list had been taken. This is relied on to show that such provisions are not merely directory, otherwise the elaborate judgment actually delivered would not have been silent on such a point. But the question there was merely which list should be taken; each list had been duly made and no provisions as to the making of lists were broken. But Willes J. does guard himself against inferences being drawn from his judgment as to points which he had not expressly dealt with, by saying ""Assuming therefore, that this sort of objection by way of challenge either to the array or the poll is competent in any case it was unfounded in this."" Another case referred to in the argument was Williams v. Great Western Ry. Co. 3 H. and N. 869, which shows that the omission to challenge although the facts were not known until after the time for challenge is not without effect on the rights of the parties and a comparison of that case with Doe v. Michael [1851] 16 Q. B. 620, shows that while in England the fact of a jury man being open to challenge, discovered after verdict may be ground for a new trial, yet it is discretionary with the Court to grant it and it will not do so when it is of opinion that no prejudice has been done. Their Lordships therefore are of opinion that the decision of Monet J. on the objection to the verdict founded on the omission duly to revise the lists was right. Counsel for the appellants pressed the Board not to weaken any of the safeguards provided by the Legislature for securing fair and impartial juries, but their Lordships fail to see that the decision of Monet J. has that effect.
As to the next point the juror objected to, was one Hector Barsalou who was brother of Erasmus Barsalou who was husband of an aunt of the plaintiff. It is obvious that this is not relationship or affinity. But Erasmus Barsalou had been the tutor or testamentary guardian of the plaintiff who was at the time of the trial not much over twenty-one and whose father had died when the plaintiff was an infant so that Erasmus Barsalou had brought him up. Hector Barsalou no doubt knew the plaintiff fairly well as his brother's ward but that was all and both he and Erasmus gave evidence satisfactory to the judge as to interest in the cause. The case as to communications with the jury broke down. The witnesses who gave the strongest evidence as to it were claim agents of the appellant company and it was their duty to inform the appellant's legal advisers at once if during the trial they observed anything which at the time they really thought serious. During the trial appellants' counsel did have some information given him which led him to ask Hector Barsalou if he was allied to the plaintiff. He answered truly that he was not, and the question was not pushed further. The judge finds emphatically that the appellants proved no case on these points. The Court of Review adopted the findings of fact of the judge. Their Lordships would require a very strong case to induce them to differ with the judge who heard the witnesses, and on a consideration of the evidence they find no such case, but, on the contrary, agree with the judge.
As to the point whether a requete civile was the proper procedure, their Lordships do not think it open, as neither the decision of the Court of King's Bench nor the disallowance of the demurrer by Monet. J. was appealed from. The decision of the King's Bench was not interlocutory for the purpose of an appeal from it under the rule acted on in this country, as it would have been final if decided the other way. Even if open, a decision on the point is unnecessary, as, in their Lordships' view the requete civile failed in proof, and their Lordships would not desire, unless it were necessary to express any opinion on a question of form and practice in the Quebec Courts, with which the judges of those Courts are far more familiar than they are. Their Lordships see no reason for interfering as they were asked to do, with any of the interlocutory orders as to costs, and they will humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.

2. It may be pertinent to mention that Ms S.K Bhatia was also appointed along with the respondent herein. According to Mr P.S Patwalia, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent, this case is covered by the judgment of this Court in State of Punjab v. S.K Bhatia 2010 11 SCC 672.
3. The brief facts of this case which are relevant to dispose of the appeal are recapitulated as under: the respondent was appointed as Assistant Advocate General and thereafter he was appointed as Deputy Advocate General and Senior Deputy Advocate General in the State of Punjab. The respondent superannuated on 31-3-2003. The pensionary benefits were denied to the respondent, then he approached the High Court and made grievance that the respondent was wrongly denied pensionary benefits. It may be pertinent to mention that some similarly placed persons were also denied pensionary benefits after their superannuation and in the writ petitions of V.P Parashar, D.N Rampal and S.K Bhatia, the High Court allowed their writ petitions and directed the State of Punjab to give them pensionary benefits. Mr Patwalia has particularly referred to the judgment of S.K Bhatia who was appointed along with the respondent herein.
4. The learned Single Judge has also quoted the terms and conditions of the appointment of S.K Bhatia, which would also be the same in the case of the respondent herein. The terms and conditions of the appointment read as under:
?(i) They will be whole time government employees and will do all criminal and miscellaneous work entrusted to them by the Advocate General, Punjab,
(ii) Their appointment is purely temporary and services are terminable without assigning any reason and without notice,
(iii) For conducting civil cases only, they will be paid two-third of the prescribed fee,
(iv) If on any particular day they have no criminal case to conduct in the High Court, fees payable to them in civil cases will be reduced by the amount of their salary for that day,
(v) In the matter of leave and travelling allowances, they will be governed by the Punjab Civil Services Rules,
(vi) House rent allowance will be admissible to them,
(vii) Their services are contractual in nature and, as such, they will not be entitled to any other benefit viz. pension, gratuity and encashment of leave, etc.
(viii) Their appointment would be against a non-pensionable post.?
5. The learned Single Judge, after elaborately dealing with the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties, clearly came to the conclusion that appointment of S.K Bhatia was not in the nature of contract of personal service but as a regular government employee. The learned Single Judge has held:
?? I hold that the appointment of the petitioner was not in the nature of contract of personal service, but as a regular government employee.?
6. The judgment of the learned Single Judge in S.K Bhatia was challenged before the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The judgment of the Single Judge was upheld by the Division Bench. The order of the Division Bench reads as under:
?Heard. The learned Single Judge has held, inter alia, on the basis of the Notification dated 3-3-1980, as also the view taken in D.N Rampal case and in V.P Parashar case that the appointment of the petitioner was not in the nature of contract of personal service but as regular government employee. The learned Single Judge has also held that stipulation of the condition that the employment is contractual was wholly arbitrary, unjust and unconstitutional.
Further, the learned Single Judge has applied the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P 1991 1 SCC 212 and distinguished the decision in State of U.P v. U.P State Law Officers Assn.3 on the basis of mode of initial appointment of the respondent as Assistant Advocate General and therefore her appointment as Deputy Advocate General.
Dismissed.

7. The State of Punjab challenged the judgment of the Division Bench before this Court. This Court, in appeal, passed the following order:
?IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5810 OF 2000
state of punjab and another . . Appellants;
Versus
s.k bhatia and others . . Respondents.
Order
1. The matter relates to termination of the first respondent as Deputy Advocate General by the State of Punjab. The respondent challenged the termination order dated 19-7-1993 as illegal on the ground that her appointment was as a regular government servant and not a contractual engagement as counsel. The learned Single Judge by judgment dated 30-5-1997 upheld her contention and allowed her writ petition, declared the termination order dated 19-7-1993 as illegal and quashed it. He also held that the first respondent was entitled to all consequential benefits. The intra-court appeal filed by the appellants was dismissed by the Division Bench on 6-2-1998. The said judgment is under challenge.
2. The impugned judgment of the High Court dated 6-2-1998 in the case of the first respondent was followed by the High Court in a subsequent similar case relating to termination of a Senior Deputy Advocate General?G.S Cheema v. State of Punjab CWP No. 8273 of 1999 decided on 22-4-2004 P&H. The State challenged the decisions of the High Court in the case of the first respondent (in this appeal) and in G.S Cheema (in CA No. 6057 of 2004). Both appeals were being listed together for final hearing.
3. When the appeals came up on 29-1-2009, the learned counsel for the State submitted that the State Government has taken a decision to implement the order of the High Court in G.S Cheema and absorb him in service. Recording the said submission, CA No. 6057 of 2004 was dismissed.
4. With reference to this appeal (relating to S.K Bhatia), the learned counsel for the State sought time to secure specific instructions. Thereafter, the matter was adjourned to 19-2-2009 at the request of the counsel for the State and again adjourned at his request today. When the matter came up today, the learned counsel for the State submitted that he has not received any instructions from the State.
5. When the State Government has accepted the decision rendered by the High Court in G.S Cheema, which followed the impugned judgment, the State Government has to adopt the same yardstick in this case also, unless there are any distinguishing factors or circumstances. The learned counsel for the appellant has not been able to show any difference between the facts of this case, and the facts in G.S Cheema.
6. We are also informed that during the pendency of the proceedings, the first respondent has attained the age of superannuation and all that therefore remains to be done is to process and disburse the terminal/retiral benefits.
7. In view of the above we dismiss this appeal. Needless to say that the retiral benefits due to the respondent in accordance with law, will have to be processed expeditiously, that is, within four months.?
8. Mr Patwalia submits that the case of the respondent is squarely covered by S.K Bhatia because she was also appointed on the same day by the same order in the same position and the benefits which were extended to S.K Bhatia should also be given to the respondent herein.
9. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
10. The learned counsel appearing for the State of Punjab could not distinguish the case of the respondent with S.K Bhatia and other cases. Consequently, the respondent herein, who has already attained superannuation from service would also be entitled to get pensionary and other benefits due to him in accordance with law.
11. We direct that all the pensionary and other benefits, if any, be given to the respondent within four months from the date of communication of this order. In the special facts and circumstances of the case, we deem it appropriate to direct the State of Punjab to pay costs of Rs. 25,000 to the respondent. Let the costs be paid within four weeks from the date of communication of this order. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed (sic) and disposed of.

"I.D Dua, J.? This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, dated March 13, 1968 affirming the order of a learned Single Judge of that Court directing that a complaint be filed against the appellant for his prosecution for making a false statement in para 10 of his affidavit, dated July 6, 1960, to the effect that he had not been acting as Sarpanch till December 7, 1957.
2. The relevant facts necessary for understanding the controversy may now be briefly stated. Chajoo Ram, appellant, was elected Sarpanch of the Nyaya Panchayat of Risia Bazar, Tehsil Nanpara, District Bahraich at the election held for that office on October 29, 1956. Radhey Shyam (respondent in this Court) who was defeated in that election filed an election petition which was dismissed on June 3, 1958. During the trial of that petition an injunction was issued restraining the appellant from functioning as a Sarpanch. That order remained in force from December 3, 1956, to December 10, 1957. After the dismissal of the election petition, the appellant started functioning as Sarpanch. Several complaints also seem to have been made by Radhey Shyam and some others to the District Magistrate, alleging irregularities to have been committed by the appellant. As no action was taken on those complaints Radhey Shyam, respondent, filed a writ petition (WP No. 89 of 1960) in the Allahabad High Court praying for a mandamus directing enquiries into the allegations contained in his complaint against the appellant. This writ petition was allowed on September 4, 1961 and a writ of mandamus was issued directing the District Magistrate and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to hold an enquiry against the appellant but the question of determining whether it was in public interest to hold an enquiry was left to those authorities. In the course of the writ proceedings several affidavits were filed in the High Court by the contesting parties. We are, however, only concerned with para 10 of the affidavit, dated July 6, 1960 filed by the appellant. That paragraph reads:
?That the deponent was not acting as a Sarpanch till 7th December, 1957, when he was given over charge of the office of Sarpanch by Opposite Party No. 4 Chhotey Lal Sahayak Sarpanch. Except the cases mentioned below none were entrusted to the benches by the deponent but were entrusted by the Sahayak Sarpanch opposite party No. 4 who was acting in place of the deponent under the orders of the court after the petitioner had filed election petition. The cases mentioned below were dealt with by the deponent under the old procedure in the absence of any directions issued to him?.
Then four cases are mentioned which had been filed in November 1956. In order to fully appreciate the contents of this paragraph it is necessary to reproduce paras 9 and 10 of Radhey Shyam's affidavit, dated March 28, 1960 to which the appellant's affidavit, dated July 6, 1960 was a reply:
?9. That the Sarpanch (Opposite Party No. 3) referred many cases to the Special Bench constituted by him. 21 cases out of the first list of 22 cases were allotted to this Special Bench by him. Further out of 62 criminal cases and 35 Civil cases instituted in the year 1956-57 the Bench consisting of the deponent as a Panch (Bench No. 1) was allotted only 16 criminal and 8 civil cases whereas, it should have been allotted 21 criminal and 12 civil cases.
10. That in many cases the deponent was not informed of the dates of the hearing fixed by Sarpanch and many a time he could not, therefore, present himself in the Bench and the cases were decided in his absence. Sarpanch who was not a member of this Bench, participated in the proceedings of this Bench.?
In reply to para 9 of this affidavit the appellant had stated in his affidavit of July 6, 1960:
?There is no dispute with regard to the procedure laid down in this paragraph. It is a new amendment.?
There was a rejoinder affidavit, dated July 15, 1960 filed by Radhey Shyam in which reply to para 10 of the appellant's affidavit, dated July 6, 1960, is contained in para 8 and it reads as follows:
?Regarding para 10 ? it is false and denied that Chajoo Ram, did not act as Sarpanch till the 7th December, 1957. As a matter of fact he was acting as Sarpanch throughout in violation of the stay order passed against him. It is also denied that other cases except those mentioned by Chajoo Ram in this para were not referred to the Benches by him. Chajoo Ram was throughout acting as Sarpanch and he in that capacity referred cases to benches according to his choice. The procedure followed by Sri Chajoo Ram Opposite Party No. 3 was in violation of the procedure laid down in the Panchayat Raj Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The rest of the contents of this para are denied?
The appellant filed a counter-affidavit, dated July 24, 1960, to this rejoinder. As we are only concerned with the contents of para 10 in the appellant's affidavit, dated July 6, 1960, we need only refer to the relevant assertions in this counter-affidavit. In para 1 the deponent stated that he had not been acting as a Sarpanch on June 6, 1957 and with regard to Annexure 34 it was submitted that the entire document had been written by Shri B.P Joshi, Mantri whose duty it was to see that the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act and Rulesand by-laws made thereunder and all orders issued or authorised by the Government or prescribed authority were complied with by the Gaon Panchayat and Nyaya Panchayat and to bring to their notice any irregularity or omission on their part. Shri Chhotey Lal, Sahayak Sarpanch had gone out on June 3, 1957 and had asked the deponent to do ministerial work which he could do under the Act. Radhey Shyam, respondent, filed a further rejoinder to this counter-affidavit on the same day viz. July 24, 1960, but in this rejoinder nothing new was stated on this point.
3. On December 10, 1962, Radhey Shyam, respondent, moved in the High Court an application under Section 476 CrPC for the appellant's prosecution. The learned Single Judge directed by his order, dated January 27, 1964, that a complaint be made against the appellant in respect of two courts, one of them, which survives for our consideration, being that he had made a false statement in para 10 of his affidavit, dated July 6, 1960 to the effect that he had not been acting as Sarpanch till December 7, 1957. On Chajoo Ram's appeal before a Division Bench it was urged on behalf of Radhey Shyam as a preliminary point that the appeal was premature. This point was referred to a Full Bench, which answered the reference negativing the preliminary objection. When the appeal came back to the Division Bench it was argued on behalf of the appellant that in view of the provisions of section 479-a crpc no prosecution could be taken under section 476 of the code. This contention was repelled and it was held that a person filing an affidavit in court could not be considered to have appeared as a witness before that court as contemplated by Section 479-A. Dealing with the merits the Division Bench of the High Court observed that the respondent had placed on the record four receipts (Nos. 39 to 42) and ?a copy of the report supposed to have been submitted by the appellant as Sarpanch to the Panchayat Raj Officer? indicating that the appellant had acted as Sarpanch between June 4 and June 6, 1957. The appellant's explanation, that Chhotey Lal, Sahayak Sarpanch was on leave from June 4 to June 11, 1957 and that the appellant had merely worked for Chhotey Lal in those days, was not accepted for the reason that this explanation was neither included in the affidavit filed by the appellant in reply to the application under Section 476 CrPC nor in a supplementary affidavit filed by him in connection with some other matter. The fact that Radhey Shyam, respondent, was prompted by considerations of malice in initiating these proceedings was considered to be immaterial. With respect to the second statement, which was also the subject-matter of the learned Single Judge's direction, the Division Bench held that charge to be unsustainable and the order of the Single Judge directing a complaint to be filed with respect to that charge was set aside. The appeal was accordingly allowed in part and in regard to para 10 of the affidavit, dated July 6, 1960 it was dismissed. It is this order which is assailed before us.
4. The first point which was pressed before us relates to the effect of Section 479-A CrPC. This section was added to the Code of Criminal Procedure by Act 26 of 1955, with the object of eradicating the evils of perjury. It overrides the provisions of Sections 476 to 479. In sub-section (6) it is expressly provided that no proceedings shall be taken under Sections 476 to 479 (inclusive) for the prosecution of a person for giving or fabricating false evidence if in respect of such a person proceedings may be taken under this section. The question to be seen, however, is if Section 479-A applies to the present case. Sub-section (1) of this section, so far as relevant, lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 476 to 479 (inclusive) when a civil, revenue or criminal court is of opinion that any person appearing before it as a witness has intentionally given false evidence in any stage of judicial proceedings or has intentionally fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the judicial proceeding it may, after complying with the other conditions contained in this section, make a complaint in writing and forward the same to a Magistrate. The crucial point to be noticed in this section is that it is only a witness who has appeared before the court who can be proceeded against. Now, the appellant quite clearly did not appear as a witness before the High Court. We undoubtedly filed sworn affidavits but it is possible to hold that by doing so he could be said to have appeared as a witness. Section 479-A CrPC is, therefore, inapplicable and it cannot operate as a bar to the proceedings under Section 476 CrPC.
5. Before dealing with the merits of the case we consider it proper to refer to the proceedings before the District Magistrate, Bahraich pursuant to the order of the High Court, dated September 4, 1961. An enquiry, it appears, was got made by the District Magistrate through the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (Shri Nageshwar Singh). According to the report of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, dated January 4, 1963 Chajoo Ram, appellant, was only found to have committed some irregularities in disposing of the cases but without any dishonest motive on his part. In the opinion of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, no action was called for against the appellant. It appears that the District Magistrate on February 17, 1963 desired a further probe into the matter. Shri K.P Mathur, SDO after going through the records of the Nyaya Panchayat once again endorsed the report of his predecessor observing:
?I also agree with Shri Nageshwar Singh that the allegations had no mala fide intention, the irregularities that had been found were due to inexperience or ignorance and are mostly commonly found in all Nyaya Panchayats not only in this district but in other districts also. Shri Chajoo Ram does not appear to have abused his position in any way?.
It appears that in those proceedings also the appellant had filed an affidavit on December 8, 1961, affirming that he had not acted as Sarpanch for one year and that Chhotey Lal, Sahayak Sarpanch looked after the work of the Sarpanch during the period. Radhey Shyam, respondent, presented an application under Section 476 CrPC in the Court of the District Magistrate also praying for the appellant's prosecution under Sections 193/181/182 IPC for having deliberately filed a false affidavit. The matter was enquired into by the District Magistrate and after going through the entire material placed before him he came to the conclusion that the explanation given by Chajoo Ram was quite plausible and it was ?doubtful to deduce? from the material placed before him ?whether he had really acted as a Sarpanch of the Nyaya Panchayat or only as a Panch?. The District Magistrate specifically referred to the files of some cases on which Radhey Shyam had relied in support of his allegation that the appellant had acted as Sarpanch but the District Magistrate was unable to uphold this allegation. Four Receipts Nos. 77 and 59 to 61 were also relied upon by Radhey Shyam in support of his allegation but here again the District Magistrate was unable to hold that the appellant had acted as Sarpanch. As a result of the preliminary enquiry the District Magistrate held that the case of swearing a false affidavit was not made out against the appellant and the notice issued to him was discharged on May 4, 1964. Radhey Shyam took the matter on appeal to the Court of the Sessions Judge assailing the order of the District Magistrate, dated May 4, 1964, but without success. That court also came to the conclusion that the appellant was not shown to have acted as Sarpanch during the period in question. The final conclusion of the Sessions Judge was expressed in these words:
?The Court has also to consider whether after filing a complaint there is a possibility of conviction. The laches pointed out on behalf of the appellant committed by Chajoo Ram can be explained easily in law courts. I agree with the learned counsel for the respondent that the possibility of the conviction of the respondent appears to be quite remote. The learned court below after carefully considering all the facts and circumstances of the case came to the conclusion that it is not a fit case in which a complaint should be filed, and I agree with the view of the learned lower court. All the circumstances have been fully explained by Chajoo Ram.?
We are informed at the bar that a revision to the High Court against the order of the Session Judge was also dismissed but that order is not included in the printed record.
6. Before us reliance has been placed on four receipts viz. Receipt 59 and 60, dated June 4, 1957, for 12p. as price of application form, Receipt 61, dated June 6, 1957 on account of price of application form and Receipt 77, dated June 4, 1957 for 53p. on account of summons fee which is said to have been received by the appellant. On these days, according to the appellant, the Sahayak Sarpanch was on leave. There is nothing to suggest that this explanation is false and we do not think that on the basis of these three receipts the appellant can be said to have acted as a Sarpanch. It is not shown that this was the function only of the Sarpanch and a panch could in no circumstances sign a receipt. The next document on which reliance is placed is a kind of a report to the Panchayat Raj Officer, dated June 6, 1957, informing him that some Panchas had not attended since the establishment of the Panchayat. In this document the appellant's signatures and the signatures of the Secretary, B.P Joshi, both appear below the endorsement forwarding this report to the Panchayat Inspector for information and necessary action. This was explained by the appellant in his affidavit where he stated that the Secretary had inserted the word ?Sarpanch? and on the appellant's objection to the use of this word, the Secretary had replied that this was a formal matter. From this document also we do not think it is possible to hold that the appellant intended to act as Sarpanch on June 6, 1957.
7. The prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by courts only in those cases where the perjury appears to be deliberate and conscious and the conviction is reasonably probable or likely. No doubt giving of false evidence and filing false affidavits is an evil which must be effectively curbed with a strong hand but to start prosecution for perjury too readily and too frequently without due care and caution and on inconclusive and doubtful material defeats its very purpose. Prosecution should be ordered when it is considered expedient in the interests of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely because there is some inaccuracy in the statement which may be innocent or immaterial. There must be prima facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance and the court should be satisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the charge. In the present case we do not think the material brought to our notice was sufficiently adequate to justify the conclusion that it is expedient in the interests of justice to file a complaint. The approach of the High Court seems some- what mechanical and superficial: it does not reflect the requisite judicial deliberation: it seems to have ignored the fact that the appellant was a Panch and authorised to act as such and his explanation was not implausible. The High Court further appears to have failed to give requisite weight to the order of the District Magistrate which was confirmed by the Sessions Judge, in which it was considered inexpedient to initiate prosecution on the charge of alleged false affidavit that the appellant had not acted as Sarpanch during the period of the stay order. The subject-matter of the charge before the District Magistrate was substantially the same as in the present case. Lastly, there is also the question of long lapse of time of more than ten years since the filing of the affidavit which is the subject-matter of the charge. This factor is also not wholly irrelevant for considering the question of expediency of initiating prosecution for the alleged perjury. In view of the nature of the alleged perjury in this case this long delay also militates against expediency of prosecution. And then by reason of the pendency of these proceedings since 1962 and earlier similar proceedings before the District Magistrate also the appellant must have suffered both mentally and financially. In view of all these circumstances we are constrained to allow the appeal and set aside the order directing complaint to be filed.

"M.H Beg, C.J? This appeal by special leave indicates how, despite the settled practice of this Court not to interfere, as a general rule, with orders of an interlocutory nature, such as one on an application for the amendment of a plaint, this Court feels compelled, in order to promote uniform standards and views on questions basic for a sound administration of justice, and, in order to prevent very obvious failures of justice, to interfere even in such a matter in a very exceptional case such as the one now before us seems to us to be.
2. Procedural law is intended to facilitate and not to obstruct the course of substantive justice. Provisions relating to pleadings in civil cases are meant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable Courts to determine what is really at issue between parties, and to prevent deviations from the course which litigation on particular causes of action must take.
3. Order 6 Rule 2 Civil Procedure Code says:
?Every pleading shall contain, and contain only a statement in a concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, and shall, when necessary, be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively. Dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in figures.?
Order 6 Rule 4 indicates cases in which particulars of its pleading must be set out by a party. And, Order 6 Rule 6 requires only such conditions precedent to be distinctly specified in a pleading as a party wants to put in issue. Order 6 Rule 5 provides for such ?further and better statement of the nature of the claim or defence, or further and better particulars of any matter stated in any pleading?... as the Court may order, and ?upon such terms, as to costs and otherwise, as may be just?. Order 6 Rule 7, contains a prohibition against departure of proof from the pleadings except by way of amendment of pleadings. After some provisions relating to special cases and circumstances, and for signing, verification and striking out of pleadings, comes Order 6 Rule 17 which reads as follows :
?The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.?
4. It is clear from the foregoing summary of the main rules of pleadings that provisions for the amendment of pleadings, subject to such terms as to costs and giving of all parties concerned necessary opportunities to meet exact situations resulting from amendments, are intended for promoting the ends of justice and not for defeating them. Even if a party or its Counsel is inefficient in setting out its case initially the shortcoming can certainly be removed generally by appropriate steps taken by a party which must no doubt pay costs for the inconvenience or expense caused to the other side from its omissions. The error is not incapable of being rectified so long as remedial steps do not unjustifiably injure rights accrued.
5. It is true that, if a plaintiff seeks to alter the cause of action itself and to introduce indirectly, through an amendment of his pleadings, an entirely new or inconsistent cause of action, amounting virtually to the substitution of a new plaint or a new cause of action in place of what was originally there, the Court will refuse to permit it if it amounts to depriving the party against which a suit is pending of any right which may have accrued in its favour due to lapse of time. But, mere failure to set out even an essential fact does not, by itself, constitute a new cause of action. A cause of action is constituted by the whole bundle of essential facts which the plaintiff must prove before he can succeed in his suit. It must be antecedent to the institution of the suit. If any essential fact is lacking from averments in the plaint the cause of action will be defective. In that case, an attempt to supply the omission has been and could sometimes be viewed as equivalent to an introduction of a new cause of action which, cured of its shortcomings, has really become a good cause of action. This, however, is not the only possible interpretation to be put on every defective state of pleadings. Defective pleadings are generally curable if the cause of action sought to be brought out was not ab initio completely absent. Even very defective pleadings may be permitted to be cured, so as to constitute a cause of action where there was none, provided necessary conditions such as payment of either any additional Court fees, which may be payable, or, of costs of the other side are complied with. It is only if lapse of time has barred the remedy on a newly constituted cause of action that the Courts should, ordinarily, refuse prayers for amendment of pleadings.
6. In the case before us, the appellant-plaintiff Ganesh Trading Co., Karnal, had filed a suit ?through Shri Jai Parkash?, a partner of that firm, based on a promissory note, dated August 25, 1970, for recovery of Rs 68,000. The non-payment of money due under the promissory note was the real basis. The suit was filed on August 24, 1973, just before the expiry of the period of limitation for the claim for payment. The written statement was filed on June 5, 1974, denying the assertions made in the plaint. It was also asserted that the suit was incompetent for want of registration of the firm and was struck by the provisions of Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act.
7. On August 31, 1974, the plaintiff filed an amendment application wherein it was stated that the plaintiff had ?inadvertently omitted certain material facts which are not necessary to incorporate in the plaint so as to enable the Hon'ble Court to consider and decide the subject-matter of the suit in its true perspective and which it is necessary to do in order to meet ends of justice?. It was explained there that the omission consisted of a failure to mention that the plaintiff firm, Ganesh Trading Co., Karnal, had been actually dissolved on July 15, 1973, on which date a deed of dissolution of the firm was executed. The trial court had refused to allow the amendment by its order dated April 8, 1975, on the ground that it amounted to the introduction of a new cause of action.
8. On a Revision application before the High Court, the High Court observed:
?The suit originally instituted was filed on behalf of a firm through one of the partners... in the amendment prayed for, a new claim is being sought to be laid on the basis of new facts.?
It examined the new averments relating to the shares of the partners and the execution of the deed of dissolution of the firm on July 15, 1973. It then said:
?It is on the basis of these averments that the title of the suit is sought to be changed from Ganesh Trading Company, Karnal, through Shri Jai Parkash son of Shri Hari Ram, resident of Railway Road, Karnal, to dissolved firm, through Shri Jai Parkash son of Shri Hari Ram, resident of Railway Road, Karnal, ex-partner of the said firm. It would be seen that the change in the heading of the suit is not being sought merely on the ground of misdescription or there being no proper description, the cause of action remaining the same, but on the other hand, the change in the heading of the plaint has been sought on the basis of the new facts prayed, to be allowed to be averred in the amendment plaint, for which new basis has been given alleging the dissolution of the partnership on a date before the suit was filed in the Court.?
9. We are unable to share the view taken by the High Court. The High Court had relied on A.K Gupta & Sons Ltd. v. Damodar Valley Corporation AIR 1967 SC 95. In that case the plaintiff had sought a declaration of his rights under the terms of a contract. The suit was decreed. But, as the first appellate Court had reversed the decree on the ground that Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act barred the grant of a mere declaratory decree in such a case, the appellant had sought leave, by filing an amendment application in its second appeal before the High Court seeking to add a relief to recover such monies as may be found due to him on proper accounting. By a majority, the view expressed by this Court was that the amendment should be allowed although the Court affirmed the principle that, an a rule, a party should not be allowed, by means of an amendment, to set up a new cause of action particularly when a suit on the new case or cause of action is barred by time.
10. On that occasion, this Court had also referred to Charan Das v. Amir Khan 47 IA 255 and L.J Leach & Co. Ltd. v. Jardine Skinner & Co. AIR 1957 SC 357, to hold that ?a different or additional approach to the same facts? could be allowed by amendment even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation. It had pointed out that the object of rules of procedure is to decide the rights of the parties and not to punish them for their mistakes or shortcoming. It also said that no question of limitation, strictly speaking, arose in such cases because what was sought to be brought in was merely a clarification of what was already there. It said (at p. 98):
?The expression ?cause of action? in the present context does not mean ?every fact which it is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed? as was said in Cooke v. Gill 1873 8 CP 107, 116, in a different context, for if it were so, no material fact could ever be amended or added and, of course, no one would want to change or add an immaterial allegation by amendment. That expression for the present purpose only means, a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts. Such a view was taken in Robinson v. Unicos Property Corporation Ltd. 1962 2 All ER 24, and it seems to us to be the only possible view to take. Any other view would make the rule futile. The words ?new case? have been understood to mean ?new set of ideas?: Dornan v. J.W Ellis & Co. Ltd. 1962 1 All ER 303. This also means to us to be a reasonable view to take. No amendment will be allowed to introduce a new set of ideas to the prejudice of any right acquired by any party by lapse of time.
11. The High Court had also referred to Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal v. National Building Material Supply, Gurgaon 1969 1 SCC 869, but had failed to follow the principle which was clearly laid down in that case by this Court. There, the plaintiff had instituted a suit in the name of Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal which was the name in which the business of a firm was carried on. Later on, the plaintiff had applied to amend the plaint so that the description may be altered into ?Manohar Lal Proprietor Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal?. The plaintiff also sought to clarify para 1 of the plaint so that it may be evident that ?Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal? was only the firm's name. The defendant pleaded that Manohar Lal was not the sole proprietor. One of the objections of the defendant in that case was that the suit by Manohar Lal as sole owner would be time barred on July 18, 1952, when the amendment was sought. In that case, the High Court had taken the hypertechnical view that Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal being ?a non-existing person?, the trial court could not allow an amendment which converted a non-existing person into a ?person? in the eye of law so that the suit may not be barred by time. This Court while reversing this hypertechnical view observed (at p. 1269):
?Rules of procedure are intended to be a handmaid to the administration of justice. A party cannot be refused just relief merely because of some mistake, negligence, inadvertence or even infraction of the rules of procedure. The Court always gives leave to amend the pleading of a party, unless it is satisfied that the party applying was acting mala fide, or that by his blunder, he had caused injury to his opponent which may not be compensed for by an order of costs. However negligent or careless may have been the first omission, and however, late the proposed amendment, the amendment may be allowed if it can be made without injustice to the other side.?
12. Purushottam Umedbhai & Co. v. Manilal & Sons AIR 1961 SC 325, was a case of a partnership firm where this Court pointed out that Section 4 of the Partnership Act uses the term ?firm? or the ?firm name? as ?a compendious description of all the partners collectively?. Speaking of the provisions of Order 30, CivilProcedure Code this Court said there (at p. 991):
?The introduction of this provision in the Code was an enabling one which permitted partners constituting a firm to sue or be sued in the name of the firm. This enabling provision, however, accorded no such facility or privilege to partners constituting a firm doing business outside India. The existence of the provisions of Order 30 in the Code does not mean that a plaint filed in the name of a firm doing business outside India is not a suit in fact by the partners of that firm individually.?
13. We think that the view expressed by Narula, CJ., in Mohan Singh v. Kanshi Ram Civil Revision 533 of 1975 decided on December 15, 1975, reported in 1976 CLJ Civil, p. 135 which was dissented from by the Division Bench of the High Court is correct. In that case, the learned Judge had rightly followed the principles laid down by this Court in Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal and had also agreed with the view taken in Ippili Satyanarayana v. Amadalavalasa Co-operative Agricultural & Industrial Society Ltd. AIR 1975 AP 22, where it held that the defendant was not prejudiced by the amendment of the description at all.
14. In the case before us also, the suit having been instituted by one of the partners of a dissolved firm the mere specification of the capacity in which the suit was filed could not change the character of the suit or the case. It made no difference to the rest of the pleadings or to the cause of action. Indeed, the amendment only sought to give notice to the defendant of facts which the plaintiff would and could have tried to prove in any case. This notice was being given, out of abundant caution, so that no technical objection may be taken that what was sought to be proved was outside the pleadings.
15. We also agree with the view taken by the Nagpur High Court in Agarwal Jorawarmal v. Kasam AIR 1937 Nag 314, where Vivian Bose, J., said (at p. 315):
?It is argued on behalf of the defendants that Order 30 Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code indicates that a suit can be filed in the name of the firm by some of the partners only if the partnership is existing at the date of the filing of the suit. The argument has no force in view of the finding that the firm was not dissolved by reason of the insolvency of one of its partners. But even if it has been dissolved, the effect of dissolution is not to render the firm non-existent. It continues to exist for all purposes necessary for its winding up. One of these is of course the recovery of moneys due to it by suit or otherwise.?
16. We think that the amendment sought does not alter the cause of action. It only brings out correctly the capacity of the plaintiff suing. It does not change the identity of the plaintiff who remains the same.
17. The result is that we allow this appeal and set aside the orders of the High Court and the trial court. We allow the amendment application and send back the case to the trial court. We direct that the trial court will now permit the defendant to file such further objections, if any, as the defendant may wish to file within 14 days of the receipt of the record by the trial court. It will then proceed to decide the case in accordance with law. Costs to abide the results of the litigation.

"D.P Mohapatra, J.? Leave granted.
2. The three appellants, Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma, Manoranjan Prasad Verma and Rajiv Ranjan Prasad Verma are sons of the late Shri Kashi Nath Prasad Verma. They have three other brothers who are not directly involved in the present proceedings. The late Kashi Nath Prasad Verma was the owner of Khasra No. 213, Plot No. 1172, in Village Srinagar, within Siwan Police Station. On his death his six sons succeeded to the property. Appellant 1 is a Neurosurgeon at Patna; Appellant 2 is the Manager of Pathar Jhora Tea Gardens in Jalpaiguri and Appellant 3 is a retired Marketing Manager of Jay Shree Tea and Industries Ltd., Delhi. Respondent 2, Manish Prasad Singh, an Advocate, is the Secretary of Kanishka Sahkari Grih Nirman Samiti Limited, Sewan (hereinafter referred to as ?the Society?) a cooperative society engaged in purchasing land from different persons and after developing and dividing it into small pieces selling the plots to different customers. The appellants agreed to sell the land in Village Srinagar to Respondent 2 for a consideration of Rs 16,00,000. The respondent paid a sum of Rs 11,00,000 to the appellants by way of drafts drawn in their favour on 7-12-1992. The appellants executed a registered sale deed in respect of the land in favour of the Society. It is the case of the appellants that on the insistence of Respondent 2 two other brothers of the appellants signed the sale deed as witnesses. By way of a further safeguard the appellants executed a separate indemnity deed on the same day in which they undertook to indemnify any loss caused to the Society on account of any objection which may be raised by any co-sharer against transfer of the land in future. The appellants assert that they have delivered possession of the land to the Society on the same day. Another brother of the appellants Priya Ranjan Prasad Verma also executed a sale deed in favour of the Society alienating his portion of the land.
3. On registration of the sale deed Respondent 2 handed over three cheques to the appellants for the sum of Rs 5,50,000. When the appellants presented the said cheques in the bank the same were dishonoured on account of insufficiency of amount in the account of the drawer. Respondent 2 had issued a separate cheque in favour of Priya Ranjan Prasad Verma which was also dishonoured for the same reason.
4. Prior to the execution of the sale deed Akhil Ranjan Prasad Verma, brother of the appellants had filed a suit, Title Suit No. 118 of 1990 for partition alleging inter alia that though the properties left by their father had been partitioned amongst the brothers in 1971 no division by metes and bounds had taken place. On 5-12-1992 on the application filed under Order 39 of the Civil Procedure Code the learned Subordinate Judge, Siwan passed an interim order restraining the appellants from disturbing the status quo or transferring the land of Schedule I to the plaint but no injunction was passed in respect of the land described in Schedule IV of the plaint in which the property in dispute in the present proceeding is included. According to the appellants the plaintiff, Akhil Ranjan Prasad Verma did not press his prayer for injunction in respect of the Schedule IV properties. It is the further case of the appellants that between 9-12-1992 to 18-12-1992 Respondent 2 sold portions of the land sold by them to several other persons.
5. When the cheques issued by Respondent 2 in their favour bounced, the appellants made several requests to the said respondent for payment of the amount. On each such occasion the said respondent avoided to pay the amount promising to do so within a short time. Finally on 21-10-1995 the appellants through their advocate sent a notice to Respondent 2 reminding him that the cheques issued by him in favour of the appellants had bounced due to insufficiency of funds. Finding that Respondent 2 had no intention to pay the amount, the appellants lodged a first information report under Sections 406, 420 and 120-B IPC with Siwan Police Station on 11-11-1995 which was registered as Siwan Mafsil Case No. 191 of 1995. In the said FIR Respondent 2 and Avdesh Narayan Rai who was the Vice-President of the cooperative society were named as the accused. The police after investigating into the allegations made in the FIR filed a charge-sheet against Respondent 2 and Avdesh Narayan Rai. The appellants also filed three suits for realisation of the amount due to them.
6. Shortly thereafter on 14-12-1995 Respondent 2 filed Complaint No. 1282 of 1995 in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siwan against the appellants alleging commission of offences under Section 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), Section 423 (dishonest or fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of consideration), Section 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation), Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and Section 120-B IPC (criminal conspiracy). It is the case of the appellants that the FIR was filed as a counterblast to the criminal case and the civil suits filed by them against Respondent 2.
7. In the complaint Respondent 2 alleged inter alia that by conspiring together all the accused have defaulted and cheated the Society and the complainant by giving false, concocted and wrongful information and assurances saying to have a sada ?kora? and thus they induced the complainant to enter into negotiations and also to advance them a heavy amount with their ulterior design to acquire wrongful gain to themselves and for wrongful loss to the Society and the complainant ? both monetary and reputational. Some averments in the complaint relevant for the purpose of this proceeding are extracted hereunder:
?That at the time of giving proposal to the complainant for buying the said land, Accused 1 asserted that the said land has fallen exclusively to the share and possession of three brothers (all accused) after the partition of the estate left by late Kashi Nath Prasad Verma among all his six sons and a ?kora? to this effect has also been prepared and signed by all the brothers. Accused 1 also said that the said kora was not available at that time and he would show as and when need be.
That all accused hail from a very sound and respectable family and Accused 1 specially being a renowned doctor, appeared to be more trustworthy to the complainant. The complainant showing due respect to Accused 1 believed him and entered into negotiation with him for purchase of said land.
That ultimately all the accused appeared at Siwan for executing the sale deeds in favour of the Society on a date fixed earlier by them. Just before the execution of the sale deed the complainant asked the accused to show the ?kora? prepared and signed by them (all the six brothers). The accused did not show the ?kora? and assured that all the brothers will join the deed. The accused will execute the sale deeds and rest three brothers will join the sale deeds as attesting witnesses.
That the sale deeds in question were scribed at the direction and dictation of the accused in favour of the Society in respect of entire land but only two brothers out of rest three came to join the deeds as attesting witnesses and one of them i.e sixth brother namely Praful Ranjan Prasad Verma did not appear to do the same as assured by Accused 1 to the complainant.
That in order to avoid future complications the complainant proposed the accused either to retain 1/6th share of land for themselves and to execute sale deeds in respect of only five shares of land or to refund the money to the complainant given to them as advance consideration money. But the accused did not agree to the proposals of the complainant saying that they will execute an agreement to the effect that in case of any future trouble to the Society, the executant i.e the accused will be liable to compensate the Society. Thus the complainant, seeing no alternative, agreed to the proposal of the accused to execute sale deeds in respect of entire lands and sale deeds were executed accordingly.
That in the meantime, some days after the execution of the said sale deed, the complainant came to know that Title Suit No. 118 of 1990 filed by Akhil Ranjan Prasad Verma, one of the six brothers of the accused as plaintiff against Priya Ranjan Prasad Verma and five others as defendants was sub judiced in the Court of Sub-Judge III, Siwan, long before the starting of the negotiation for the sale and purchase of said land. Besides, another suit bearing No. 68 of 1983, Nagendra Nath Sinha ? plaintiffs v. Singhashani Devi ? defendants has also been pending in the Court of Munsif I, Siwan from long before the starting of the negotiation of sale and purchase of the said land. The accused had concealed these facts from the complainant at the time of negotiation and execution of the aforesaid sale deeds.
That from the facts detailed above, it is quite clear that accused have deliberately and intentionally defrauded and cheated the Society and the complainant by suppressing some facts and giving false and concocted information and assurances to the complainant so as to make him believe that the deal is a fair one and free of troubles. The accused did so with an intention to acquire wrongful gain for themselves and to cause wrongful loss to the Society and the complainant. The accused have always kept the complainant in wrong box and thus they have induced the complainant to enter into negotiation and advance consideration money to them.
That by suppressing facts relating to two pending cases from before and filing criminal case against the complainant and civil cases against the Society the accused have lowered down the prestige and reputation of the Society and the complainant in the eyes of the members, customers and the public at large, although the complainant has committed no fault since the amount due to the accused has already been entered into the cash-book of the Society and it has come in the audit report done for the year 1994-95.?
8. In the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp 1 SCC 335 this Court in the backdrop of interpretation of various relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC gave the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, making it clear that it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly-defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list to myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised: (SCC pp. 378-79, para 102)
?102. (1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.?
9. In the decision this Court added a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised ?very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases?.
10. The principles laid down in this decision have been followed in several decisions of this Court like Rupan Deol Bajaj v. Kanwar Pal Singh Gill 1995 6 SCC 194, Rajesh Bajaj v. State NCT of Delhi 1999 3 SCC 259, State of Kerala v. O.C Kuttan 1999 2 SCC 651, P.S Rajya v. State Of Bihar. 1996 9 SCC 1, State Of Orissa v. Bansidhar Singh 1996 2 SCC 194.
11. The question is whether the case of the appellants comes under any of the categories enumerated in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal. Is it a case where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in entirety do not make out a case against the accused? For determination of the question it becomes relevant to note the nature of the offences alleged against the appellants, the ingredients of the offences and the averments made in the complaint.
12. On a reading of the complaint, portions of which have been extracted earlier, it is clear that the main offence alleged to have been committed by the appellants is ?cheating? punishable under Section 420 IPC.
13. Cheating is defined in Section 415 of the Code as:
?415. Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to ?cheat?.
Explanation.?A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.?
The section requires?
(1) deception of any person;
(2)(a) fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person
(i) to deliver any property to any person, or
(ii) to consent that any person shall retain any property; or
(b) intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property.
14. On a reading of the section it is manifest that in the definition there are set forth two separate classes of acts which the person deceived may be induced to do. In the first place he may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to any person. The second class of acts set forth in the section is the doing or omitting to do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived. In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest. In the second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional but not fraudulent or dishonest.
15. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, that is the time when the offence is said to have been committed. Therefore it is the intention which is the gist of the offence. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made the promise cannot be presumed.
16. Judged on the touchstone of the principles noted above, the present case, in our considered view warrants interference inasmuch as the ingredients of the offence of cheating punishable under Section 420 IPC and its allied offences under Sections 418 and 423 has not been made out. So far as the offences under Sections 469, 504 and 120-B are concerned even the basic allegations making out a case thereunder are not contained in the complaint. That being the position the case comes within the first category of casesenumerated in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal and as such warrants interference by the Court. Reading the averments in the complaint in entirety and accepting the allegations to be true, the ingredients of intentional deception on the part of the accused right at the beginning of the negotiations for the transaction has neither been expressly stated nor indirectly suggested in the complaint. All that Respondent 2 has alleged against the appellants is that they did not disclose to him that one of their brothers had filed a partition suit which was pending. The requirement that the information was not disclosed by the appellants intentionally in order to make Respondent 2 part with the property is not alleged expressly or even impliedly in the complaint. Therefore the core postulate of dishonest intention in order to deceive the complainant-Respondent 2 is not made out even accepting all the averments in the complaint on their face value. In such a situation continuing the criminal proceeding against the accused will be, in our considered view, an abuse of the process of the court. The High Court was not right in declining to quash the complaint and the proceeding initiated on the basis of the same.
17. Accordingly the appeals are allowed. The judgment/order dated 13-4-1999 of the Patna High Court in Criminal Miscellaneous Nos. 22880 and 24068 of 1998 is set aside and the proceeding in Criminal Case No. 22 of 1996 pending in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Siwan is quashed.

"?	Aggrieved against the appeal being allowed and the suit being dismissed, the respondent Society preferred a second appeal in SA No. 869 of 2009 before the High Court of Madras.
?	6. The learned Judge of the Madras High Court heard both the aforesaid second appeals together and by a common judgment set aside the well-considered judgments of the first appellate court.
?	10. The trial court in Suit No. 1143 of 1994 has held that the appellant was in possession of the suit property in the capacity of a watchman.
?	The issue is decided .""
?	12. The trial court relied on a judgment of the Madras High Court in Alagi Alamelu Achi v. Ponniah Mudaliar AIR 1962 Mad 149.
?	13. The trial court also came to a definite conclusion that the appellant has concealed certain vital facts and has not approached the court with clean hands and he is not entitled to the grant of discretionary relief of injunction.
?	14. The first appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the appellant was entitled to the relief of injunction because of his long possession of the suit property.
?	The first appellate court also set aside the decree passed by the trial court in OS No. 239 of 2003.
?	The High Court heard both the appeals filed by the respondent Society and the same were allowed by a common judgment dated 20-4-2011.
?	16. The High Court by a detailed reasoning set aside the judgment of the first appellate court and held that the first appellate court was not justified in reversing the judgments passed by the trial court in both the abovementioned suits, OS No. 1143 of 1994 and OS No. 239 of 2003.
?	18. In our considered view, a well-reasoned judgment and a decree passed by the trial court ought not to have been reversed by the first appellate court.
?	Possession is important when there are no title documents and other relevant records before the court, but, once the documents and records of title come before the court, it is the title which has to be looked at first and due weightage be given to it.
?	If the pleadings do not give sufficient details, they will not raise an issue, and the court can reject the claim or pass a decree on admission.
?	The court must ensure that pleadings of a case must contain sufficient particulars.
?	Truth constituted an integral part of the justice delivery system which was in vogue in the pre-Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell the truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences.
?	It is a well-accepted and settled principle that a court must discharge its statutory functions-whether discretionary or obligatory-according to law in dispensing justice because it is the duty of a court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is being done.
?	Right from inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice.
?	Concern for and duty to seek truth should not become the limited concern of the courts.
?	People would have faith in courts when they would find that truth alone triumphs in the courts.
?	In United States v. Havens 64 L Ed 2d 559 it was held that the Government may use illegally obtained evidence to impeach a defendant's fraudulent statements during cross-examination for the purpose of seeking justice, for the purpose of 'arriving at the truth, which is a fundamental goal of our legal system'.
?	If false averments, evasive denials or false denials are introduced, then the court must carefully look into it while deciding a case and insist that those who approach the court must approach it with clean hands.
?	While passing the order, the court must take into consideration the pragmatic realities and pass proper order for mesne profits.
?	It is imperative for the court to carefully analyse the pleadings and the documents on record and only on that basis the court must be governed by the prima facie case.
?	The courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.
?	The interests of justice require that any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court, by the mere circumstance that it has initiated a proceeding in the court, must be neutralised.
?	The Court in Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. ITO held that the High Court while exercising its power under Article 226 the interest of justice requires that any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court must be neutralised.
?	In Padmawati v. Harijan Sewak Sangh 2008 154 DLT 411 decided by the Delhi High Court on 6-11-2008, the Court held as under: (DLT p. 413, para 6) '6.
?	One of the aims of every judicial system has to be to discourage unjust enrichment using courts as a tool.
?	We approve the findings of the High Court of Delhi in the aforementioned case.
?	The High Court also stated: (Padmawati case, DLT pp. 414-15, para 9) '9.
?	It becomes the duty of the courts to see that such wrongdoers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in prolonging the litigation due to their money power, ultimately they must suffer the costs of all these years' long litigation.
?	Against this judgment of the Delhi High Court, Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 29197 of 2008 was preferred to this Court.
?	The special leave petition is dismissed.'
?	[the] stay granted by the court does not confer a right upon a party and it is granted always subject to the final result of the matter in the court and at the risks and costs of the party obtaining the stay.
?	The Court in para 28 of the aforesaid judgment very carefully mentioned that the litigation should not turn into a fruitful industry and observed as under: (South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. case, SCC pp. 664-65) '28. ...
?	We are of the opinion that the successful party finally held entitled to a relief assessable in terms of money at the end of the litigation, is entitled to be compensated by award of interest at a suitable reasonable rate for the period for which the interim order of the court withholding the release of money had remained in operation.'
?	The Court in the aforesaid judgment also observed that once the doctrine of restitution is attracted, the interest is often a normal relief given in restitution.
?	No litigant can derive any benefit from mere pendency of case in a court of law, as the interim order always merges in the final order to be passed in the case and if the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the interim order stands nullified automatically.
?	The maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit, which means that the act of the court shall prejudice no one, becomes applicable in such a case.
?	In such a fact situation the court is under an obligation to undo the wrong done to a party by the act of the court.
?	Any undeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the court must be neutralised, as the institution of litigation cannot be permitted to confer any advantage on a suitor from delayed action by the act of the court.'
?	The court should never permit a litigant to perpetuate illegality by abusing the legal process.
?	It is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that dishonesty and any attempt to abuse the legal process must be effectively curbed and the court must ensure that there is no wrongful, unauthorised or unjust gain for anyone by the abuse of the process of the court.
?	The courts would be fully justified even imposing punitive costs where legal process has been abused.
?	The court while rendering justice must adopt a pragmatic approach and in appropriate cases realistic costs and compensation be ordered in order to discourage dishonest litigation.
?	The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how long the defendants or respondents were compelled to contest and defend the litigation in various courts.
?	The appellants in the instant case have harassed the respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts.
?	It may take quite some time, at times years, before the court is able to see through, discern and reach to the truth.
?	43.1 It is the bounden duty of the court to uphold the truth and do justice.
?	43.2 Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether it is pleadings, affidavits or evidence.
?	Dishonest and unscrupulous litigants have no place in law courts.
?	45. Both the appeals are dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

1. For many centuries Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e ?satya? (truth) and ?ahimsa? (non-violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice-delivery system which was in vogue in the pre-Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences. However, post-Independence period has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has overshadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In the last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final.
3. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das . AIR 1963 SC 1558 this Court adverted to the aforesaid rule and revoked the leave granted to the appellant by making the following observations: (AIR p. 1558)
?It is of utmost importance that in making material statements and setting forth grounds in applications for special leave made under Article 136 of the Constitution, care must be taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue or misleading. In dealing with applications for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements which are untrue and misleading. Thus, if at the hearing of the appeal the Supreme Court is satisfied that the material statements made by the appellant in his application for special leave are inaccurate and misleading, and the respondent is entitled to contend that the appellant may have obtained special leave from the Supreme Court on the strength of what he characterises as misrepresentations of facts contained in the petition for special leave, the Supreme Court may come to the conclusion that in such a case special leave granted to the appellant ought to be revoked.?
4. In Welcom Hotel v. State of A.P AIR 1983 SC 1015 the Court held that a party which has misled the Court in passing an order in its favour is not entitled to be heard on the merits of the case.
5. In G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. Govt. of Karnataka AIR 1991 SC 1726 the Court denied relief to the appellant who had concealed the fact that the award was not made by the Land Acquisition Officer within the time specified in Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act because of the stay order passed by the High Court. While dismissing the special leave petition, the Court observed: (SCC p. 263, para 2)
?2. ? Curiously enough, there is no reference in the special leave petitions to any of the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter-affidavit. In our view, the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non-disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts. On this ground alone, the special leave petitions are liable to be rejected. It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts. If he fails to do so and suppresses material facts, his application is liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss the special leave petitions.?
6. In S.P Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath JT 1993 6 SC 331 the Court held that where a preliminary decree was obtained by withholding an important document from the court, the party concerned deserves to be thrown out at any stage of the litigation.
7. In Prestige Lights Ltd. v. State Bank Of India. 2007 8 SCC 449 it was held that in exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India the High Court is not just a court of law, but is also a court of equity and a person who invokes the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is duty-bound to place all the facts before the Court without any reservation. If there is suppression of material facts or twisted facts have been placed before the High Court then it will be fully justified in refusing to entertain a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. This Court referred to the judgment of Scrutton, L.J in R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners 1917 1 KB 486 CA, and observed: (Prestige Lights Ltd. case, SCC p. 462, para 35)
In exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court will always keep in mind the conduct of the party who is invoking such jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose full facts or suppresses relevant materials or is otherwise guilty of misleading the court, then the Court may dismiss the action without adjudicating the matter on merits. The rule has been evolved in larger public interest to deter unscrupulous litigants from abusing the process of court by deceiving it. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true, complete and correct facts. If the material facts are not candidly stated or are suppressed or are distorted, the very functioning of the writ courts would become impossible.
8. In A.V Papayya Sastry v. Govt. of A.P AIR 2007 SC 1546 the Court held that Article 136 does not confer a right of appeal on any party. It confers discretion on this Court to grant leave to appeal in appropriate cases. In other words, the Constitution has not made the Supreme Court a regular court of appeal or a court of error. This Court only intervenes where justice, equity and good conscience require such intervention.
9. In Sunil Poddar v. Union Bank of India 2008 2 SCC 326 the Court held that while exercising discretionary and equitable jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution, the facts and circumstances of the case should be seen in their entirety to find out if there is miscarriage of justice. If the appellant has not come forward with clean hands, has not candidly disclosed all the facts that he is aware of and he intends to delay the proceedings, then the Court will non-suit him on the ground of contumacious conduct.
10. In K.D Sharma v. SAIL 2008 12 SCC 481 the Court held that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary and it is imperative that the petitioner approaching the writ court must come with clean hands and put forward all the facts before the Court without concealing or suppressing anything and seek an appropriate relief. If there is no candid disclosure of relevant and material facts or the petitioner is guilty of misleading the Court, his petition may be dismissed at the threshold without considering the merits of the claim. The same rule was reiterated in G. Jayashree v. Bhagwandas S. Patel 2009 3 SCC 141.
11. This appeal, which is directed against the order dated 21-5-2001 passed by the Allahabad High Court is illustrative of how unscrupulous litigants can mislead the authorities entrusted with the task of implementing the provisions of the U.P Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960 (for short ?the Act?) and the courts for retaining possession of the surplus land. The tenure-holder, Praveen Singh did not file statement in terms of Section 9(2-A) of the Act in respect of his holding as on 24-1-1971. After about four years, the prescribed authority issued notice dated 29-11-1975 under Section 10(2) of the Act and called upon Shri Praveen Singh to show cause as to why the statement prepared under Section 10(1) of the Act may not be taken as correct and his land may not be declared surplus accordingly. A copy of the statement was sent to Shri Praveen Singh along with the notice in CLH Form 4. For the sake of convenient reference, the notice is reproduced below:
?CLH FORM 4
(See Rule 8)
[Form of notice under Section 10(2) of the U.P Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1960]
To, Name of tenure-holder Shri Praveen Singh, With parentage Address s/o Shri Raghubir Singh, and r/o Village Tisotara, PO Khas, Pargana Kirat Pur, Tehsil Najibabad, District Bijnor.
Whereas you have failed to submit a statement/have furnished incomplete/incorrect statement in respect of all your holdings in the State of Uttar Pradesh including holdings of your family members with all the required particulars within the time mentioned in the notice in CLH Form 1, published under Section 9;
And whereas the statement of all holdings held by you in the State on 8-6-1973, statement showing proposed ceiling area applicable to you and the proposed surplus land have been prepared under sub-section (1) of Section 10, they are sent to you herewith and you are hereby called upon to show cause within a period of 15 days from the date of service of this notice, why the said statement be not taken as correct.
On your failure to dispute the correctness of the statements in any court, within the time allowed, the aforesaid statement shall be treated as final and ceiling area applicable to you and the surplus land shall be determined accordingly.
Given under my hand and seal of the Court this day of 29-11-1975.
Signature of the prescribed authority of the Sub-Division
Tehsil Najibabad.?
12. The notice was delivered to Shri Praveen Singh on 3-12-1975, but he neither filed any objection to the proposed determination of his surplus land nor sought extension of time for the said purpose. After service of notice, the prescribed authority adjourned the case on 10-12-1975 and again on 19-12-1975 apparently with the hope that the tenure-holder may file objection to the statement prepared under Section 10(1). This is evident from the proceeding sheets of the two dates, which are reproduced below:
?Proceedings dated 10-12-1975 10-12-1975 File received after service of notice on the tenure-holder on 3-12-1975. It is ordered that the file be put up on 19-12-1975 after receipt of objections. sd/- Prescribed Authority Proceedings dated 19-12-1975 19-12-1975 File put up. The tenure-holder has not filed any objection despite service. It is ordered that the file be put up for ex parte orders on 27-12-1975. sd/- Prescribed Authority?
13. On 27-12-1975, the prescribed authority noted that Shri Praveen Singh has not filed any objection and declared that 18.22 acres of irrigated land was surplus in the hands of the tenure-holder. After six months and twelve days, Shri Praveen Singh submitted an application dated 8-7-1976 along with what was termed as an affidavit before the prescribed authority and prayed that ex parte order dated 27-12-1975 may be set aside and he may be given opportunity to file objections and tender evidence. The prescribed authority rejected the application on the same day i.e 8-7-1976 by observing that no valid ground has been made out for reconsidering the matter after six months.
14. The appeal preferred by Shri Praveen Singh against the order of the prescribed authority was dismissed by the Additional Commissioner (Judicial), Allahabad (Appellate Authority) in default because no one appeared on the date of hearing. The restoration application filed by Shri Praveen Singh was dismissed on 27-8-1980. He then challenged the orders of the prescribed authority and the appellate authority in Writ Petition No. 8342 of 1980, which was allowed by the High Court and the matter was remitted to the appellate authority with a direction to decide the application of Shri Praveen Singh afresh in accordance with law.
15. In compliance with the direction given by the High Court, the appellate authority reconsidered the appeal of Shri Praveen Singh but dismissed the same on the ground that the tenure-holder had not filed an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of the delay and even in the application filed for setting aside the ex parte order, no cause was shown for the delay. The appellate authority also observed that the tenure-holder had not denied receipt of notice dated 29-11-1975 issued under Section 10(2) of the Act, but did not file any objection till the passing of ex parte order on 27-12-1975 and that his assertion of having come to know of the ex parte order from Lekhpal Halqa on 7-7-1976 is not believable. It appears that after remand of the matter by the High Court, Shri Praveen Singh died and, therefore, his legal representatives (including the appellant herein) were substituted in his place.
16. The legal representatives of Shri Praveen Singh jointly filed Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 22790 of 1990 and prayed for quashing of orders dated 27-12-1975, 8-7-1976, 7-8-1990 passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate authority respectively. They also prayed for issue of a direction to the appellate authority to remand the case to the prescribed authority for entertaining their objections. In Para 3 of the writ petition, the following statement was made:
?That the petitioner's late father, against whom the proceedings had been initiated under Section 10(2) of the Ceiling Act, filed application on 8-7-1976 supported by an affidavit stating therein clearly that he was seriously ill for about ten months as such he was not in a position to file objection, and as a matter of fact he did not have any knowledge of the date of the proceedings that were being conducted before the prescribed authority. True copy of the application dated 8-7-1976 of the petitioner's late father is annexed herewith as Annexure 2. True copy of the affidavit filed in support of the application dated 8-7-1976 of the petitioner's father is annexed herewith as Annexure 3.?
(emphasis added)
17. By an order dated 7-9-1990, the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court stayed the operation of the orders passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate authority. The interim order remained operative till 21-5-2001, that is, the date on which the writ petition was finally dismissed and during the interregnum the appellant continued to enjoy the property. In the special leave petition filed against the order of the High Court, notice was issued on 12-10-2001, but the appellant's prayer for stay was declined. Thereafter, the surplus land of the tenure-holder was distributed among the landless persons who were joined as parties pursuant to order dated 27-3-2006 passed in IA No. 9 of 2004.
18. After service of notice, Respondents 1 to 3 filed counter in the form of an affidavit of Shri Pradip Kumar Singh, Additional Tahsildar, District Bijnor, U.P In his affidavit, Shri Pradip Kumar gave details of the steps taken by the prescribed authority in terms of Sections 10(1) and 10(2) of the Act and made a categorical assertion that notice issued on 29-11-1975 was duly served upon Shri Praveen Singh on 3-12-1975. This is evident from Paras 4(iv) and (v) of the counter-affidavit which read as under:
?(iv) That the averments of facts made in the list of dates against date 7-7-1976 are not admitted being incorrect. The notice in CLH Form 4 having been served on the tenure-holder on 3-12-1975, it was for him to have filed his objection. It was for the tenure-holder to have managed his affairs. It is not for a court or an authority to communicate to the tenure-holder each and every order passed by it once service of the notice is complete, the Act does not require that each and every date of proceedings and the copy or information about the final order ex parte or otherwise be served on him. The tenure-holder avoided to file his objections since he had none. The statement of surplus land is prepared by the Revenue Authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Act which is prepared on the basis of revenue records of land held by a tenure-holder in his name and there is ?presumption of correctness of the revenue record?.
(v) That the averments of fact in the list of date against date 8-7-1976 are not admitted as stated. It is submitted that an application dated 8-7-1976 filed by the tenure-holder did not dispute service of notice in CLH Form 4 dated 29-11-1975. The application was of a general nature. If a tenure-holder having been asked to file objections within 15 days of the date of service of him ?chooses not to do so?, would proceed to a presumption that he has nothing to say. Section 11 of the Act provides that where a tenure-holder chooses not to dispute and not to file any objection to the statement prepared by the prescribed authority under Section 10 of the Act within the stipulated period, the prescribed authority ?shall? accordingly determine the surplus land of the tenure-holder. Sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the Act further provides that where an application is made by a tenure-holder within thirty days of the date of an order under sub-section (11) of the Act, that being a statutory duty cast on the prescribed authority. In the present case the prescribed authority after passing order dated 27-12-1975 fixed the next date as 27-1-1976 i.e after 30 days and it is only on 27-1-1976 that the prescribed authority sent a notification regarding publication of surplus land in the Official Gazette which was so published on 5-6-1976.?
19. Shri Sunil Kumar Singh, son of the appellant Dalip Singh and grandson of late Shri Praveen Singh filed rejoinder-affidavit dated 18-2-2002. In Para 3 of the rejoinder-affidavit Shri Sunil Kumar Singh made the following statement:
?That it is denied categorically that the father of the petitioner had ever received the notice dated 29-11-1975 along with the statement of surplus land, prepared under Section 10(1) of the Act. It is humbly stated that the father of the petitioner could not file any show cause without going through the abovereferred statement prepared under Section 10(1) of the Act.?
20. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and scrutinised the record. In our opinion, the appeal is liable to be dismissed only on the ground that the tenure-holder Shri Praveen Singh did not state correct facts in the application filed by him on 8-7-1976 before the prescribed authority for setting aside the ex parte order and the appellant did not approach the High Court with clean hands inasmuch as, by making a misleading statement in Para 3 of the writ petition, an impression was created that the tenure-holder did not know of the proceedings initiated by the prescribed authority. By making the said statement, the appellant succeeded in persuading the High Court to pass an interim order which resulted in frustrating the efforts made by the authority concerned to distribute the surplus land among landless persons. Even before this Court, a patently false statement has been made in the rejoinder-affidavit on the issue of receipt of notice dated 29-11-1975 by Shri Praveen Singh.
21. A perusal of the application dated 8-7-1976 submitted by Shri Praveen Singh for setting aside the ex parte order dated 27-12-1975 passed by the prescribed authority makes it clear that he had pleaded his continuous illness for ten months as the cause for his inability to file objection. In Para 2 of the application, Shri Praveen Singh made a suggestive assertion that he had no knowledge of the proceedings initiated by the prescribed authority and he came to know about the case having been decided ex parte only on 7-7-1976 when he went to Lekhpal to procure memo. There was not even a whisper in the application that notice dated 29-11-1975 issued by the prescribed authority under Section 10(2) of the Act had not been served upon him and on that account he could not file objections within 15 days.
22. The application filed by Shri Praveen Singh was not supported by any medical certificate or other evidence which could prima facie establish that he was really sick for ten months. This is the reason why the prescribed authority refused to reconsider the order dated 27-11-1975 and the appellate authority declined to entertain his prayer for remand of the case to the prescribed authority for the purpose of fresh determination of surplus area case. Notwithstanding this, in the writ petition filed before the High Court a misleading statement was made that due to serious illness, Shri Praveen Singh could not file objection and, as a matter of fact, he did not have any knowledge of the dates of proceedings which were conducted by the prescribed authority. In view of that statement, the learned Single Judge of the High Court felt persuaded to stay the orders passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate authority which, as mentioned above, resulted in frustration of the action to be taken by the authority concerned for distribution of the surplus land to landless persons for a good period of more than eleven years and enabled the heirs of Shri Praveen Singh to retain possession of the surplus land and enjoy the same. Before the High Court also, no evidence was produced in support of the assertion regarding serious illness of Shri Praveen Singh.
23. Insofar as this Court is concerned, Shri Sunil Kumar Singh, grandson of Shri Praveen Singh and son of the appellant, boldly made a false statement that his grandfather did not receive notice dated 29-11-1975 along with the statement of surplus land prepared under Section 10(1) and he could not file any show cause without going through the statement. We are amazed at the degree of audacity with which Shri Sunil Kumar Singh could make a patently false statement on oath.
24. From what we have mentioned above, it is clear that in this case efforts to mislead the authorities and the courts have transmitted through three generations and the conduct of the appellant and his son to mislead the High Court and this Court cannot, but be treated as reprehensible. They belong to the category of persons who not only attempt, but succeed in polluting the course of justice. Therefore, we do not find any justification to interfere with the order under challenge or entertain the appellant's prayer for setting aside the orders passed by the prescribed authority and the appellate authority.
25. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. We would have saddled the appellant with exemplary costs but, keeping in view the fact that possession of the surplus land was taken in 2002 and the same has been distributed among landless poor persons, we refrain from doing so.

"S. Ratnavel Pandian, J.? These criminal appeals by special leave granted under Article 136 of the Constitution of India are preferred by the appellant questioning the correctness of the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Criminal Revision Application Nos. 98 and 97 of 1978 whereby the High Court set aside the judgment and orders dated January 2, 1978 of the Sessions Judge, Kutch at Bhuj made in Criminal Revision Application Nos. 46 and 45 of 1976 confirming the orders dated June 19, 1976 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kutch in Application Ex. Nos. 94 and 98 in Criminal Case Nos. 929 and 930 of 1973 respectively. The factual matrix that have relevance to the questions, raised and canvassed at the hearing may be briefly stated.
2. A raid conducted by the officers of the Customs Department in the business-cum-residential premises of the appellant on September 17, 1971 resulted in the seizure of some gold Lagadis bearing foreign marks, primary gold, gold ornaments and silver bricks, coins etc. to the value of about Rs 8,48,422. During the said raid a sum of Rs 79,000 was also seized. In respect of this incident, the Assistant Collector of Customs filed two separate complaints on November 26, 1973 against the appellant in the court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Anjar, being Criminal Case Nos. 929 and 930 of 1973 for offences punishable (1) under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and (2) under the Gold Control Act, 1968. After examination of the prosecution as well as the defence witnesses and recording of the statements of the appellant under Section 342 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ?Code?) arguments were advanced on behalf of the appellant/accused. The prosecution at this stage before commencing its arguments filed two applications in both the cases under Section 540 of the old Code (corresponding to Section 311 of the new Code) requesting the trial court to recall Mr Mirchandani (the Seizing Officer) for further examination and to issue summons to two more witnesses, namely, Mr K.K Das, Assistant Collector of Customs and the Deputy Chief Officer (Assayer) of Mint Master, Bombay for examination either as prosecution witnesses or as court witnesses as contemplated under the said provision. The learned Judicial Magistrate passed two orders rejecting the applications which orders, on revision by the respondents, were confirmed by the Sessions Judge. On being aggrieved by the said revisional orders, the Union of India (respondent 1 herein) preferred two Criminal Revision Application Nos. 97 and 98 of 1978. Respondent 2 namely, the State of Gujarat also preferred two other Criminal Revision Application Nos. 124 and 125 of 1978. The High Court by its common judgment, though heavily criticised the conduct of the prosecution for its deplorable and lethargic attitude in not carefully and promptly conducting the proceedings allowed all the criminal revisions for the reasons assigned therein holding thus:
?In view of what has been stated above, I accept the four petitions filed in this court by the Union of India, and the State of Gujarat, and direct the Union of India to examine the aforesaid three witnesses within a period of fortnight after the receipt of the order of this court to the trial court. After the Union of India examines the aforesaid three witnesses as aforesaid, it will be open to the accused to cross-examine all the witnesses examined by the Union of India before the learned Magistrate.?
3. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, these two appeals are preferred by the appellant. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the appellant has not directed any appeal against the judgment of the High Court in allowing the two other Revision Application Nos. 124 and 125 of 1978 filed by the Gujarat Government which were also allowed by the High Court.
4. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant vigorously challenged the legality of the impugned judgment inter alia contending that the High Court has gravely erred in allowing the second revision petitions filed by the respondent by ignoring the weighty reasons given by the trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge (before whom the first revision was filed) and thereby in permitting the respondent ? the Union of India ? to examine the three witnesses as prayed by it, notwithstanding that the case was pending before the trial court for considerable length of time and the defence argument was concluded and that the High Court, by the impugned order has permitted the prosecution to bolster up its case by filling up the lacuna and plugging the loopholes which if carried out would be detrimental and prejudicial to the appellant.
5. The next legal submission made on behalf of the appellant is that the entertainment of the second revision by the High Court is in violation of sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 397 of the new Codesince the order passed by the Magistrate was an interlocutory order and that even assuming that it was not so, the second revision by the same affected party is not entertainable.
6. Before adverting to the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant, we would examine in general the scope and intent of Section 540 of the old Code (corresponding to Section 311 of the new Code).
7. Section 540 was found in Chapter XLVI of the old Code of 1898 under the heading ?Miscellaneous?. But the present corresponding Section 311 of the new Code is found among other sections in Chapter XXIV under the heading ?General Provisions as to Enquiries and Trials?. Section 311 is an almost verbatim reproduction of section 540 of the old code except for the insertion of the words ?to be? before the word ?essential? occurring in the old section. This section is manifestly in two parts. Whereas the word used in the first part is ?may? the word used in the second part is ?shall?. In consequence, the first part which is permissive gives purely discretionary authority to the Criminal Court and enables it ?at any stage of enquiry, trial or other proceedings? under the Code to act in one of the three ways, namely,
(1) to summon any person as a witness, or
(2) to examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or
(3) to recall and re-examine any person already examined.
8. The second part which is mandatory imposes an obligation on the court ?
(1) to summon and examine, or
(2) to recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the case.
9. The very usage of the words such as ?any court?, ?at any stage?, or ?of any enquiry, trial or other proceedings?, ?any person? and ?any such person? clearly spells out that this section is expressed in the widest possible terms and do not limit the discretion of the court in any way. However, the very width requires a corresponding caution that the discretionary power should be invoked as the exigencies of justice require and exercised judicially with circumspection and consistently with the provisions of the Code. The second part of the section does not allow for any discretion but it binds and compels the court to take any of the aforementioned two steps if the fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case.
10. It is a cardinal rule in the law of evidence that the best available evidence should be brought before the court to prove a fact or the points in issue. But it is left either for the prosecution or for the defence to establish its respective case by adducing the best available evidence and the court is not empowered under the provisions of the Code to compel either the prosecution or the defence to examine any particular witness or witnesses on their sides. Nonetheless if either of the parties withholds any evidence which could be produced and which, if produced, be unfavourable to the party withholding such evidence, the court can draw a presumption under Illustration (g) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act. In such a situation a question that arises for consideration is whether the presiding officer of a court should simply sit as a mere umpire at a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost or is there not any legal duty of his own, independent of the parties, to take an active role in the proceedings in finding the truth and administering justice? It is a well accepted and settled principle that a court must discharge its statutory functions ? whether discretionary or obligatory ? according to law in dispensing justice because it is the duty of a court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is being done. In order to enable the court to find out the truth and render a just decision, the salutary provisions of Section 540 of the Code (Section 311 of the new Code) are enacted whereunder any court by exercising its discretionary authority at any stage of enquiry, trial or other proceeding can summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall or re-examine any person in attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall and re-examine any person already examined who are expected to be able to throw light upon the matter in dispute; because if judgments happen to be rendered on inchoate, inconclusive and speculative presentation of facts, the ends of justice would be defeated.
11. There are various other provisions in the new Code corresponding to the provisions of the old Code empowering the court specified therein to recall any witness or witnesses already examined or summon any witness, if it is felt necessary in the interest of justice at various stages mentioned in the concerned specific provisions.
12. A judge under Section 236 (Section 310 old Code) or a Magistrate under Section 248(3) [Sections 251-A(13) and 255-A old Code] is empowered to take evidence in respect of the previous convictions of the accused person concerned if he is charged with the previous conviction under sub-section (7) of Section 211 and if he does not admit the previous conviction. Under Section 367 (Section 375 old Code)if, when sentence of death passed by the Court of Sessions is submitted for confirmation to the High Court under Section 366(1) (Section 374 of the old Code), the High Court thinks that a further enquiry should be made into or additional evidence taken upon, any point bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the convicted person, it may make such inquiry or take such evidence itself or direct it to be made or taken by the Court of Session.
13. Under Section 391 (Section 428 old Code) the appellate court while dealing with any appeal under Chapter XXIX, if thinks additional evidence to be necessary, may after recording its reasons either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a subordinate court as the case may be. Under Section 463(2) (Section 533 old Code) if any court of appeal, reference and revision before which confession or other statement of an accused recorded or purporting to be recorded under Section 164 or Section 281 (Section 364 of the old Code) is tendered, or has been received in evidence, finds that any of the provisions of either such sections have not been complied with by the Magistrate recording the statement, the court may notwithstanding anything contained in Section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act take evidence in regard to such non-compliance and may, if satisfied that such non-compliance has not injured the accused in his defence on the merits and that he duly made the statement recorded, admit such evidence.
14. Analogous to the above provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure there are various provisions in the Civil Procedure Code also enabling the civil court to summon witnesses and examine them in the interest of justice. Under Order X Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code, the court at the first hearing of the suit or at any subsequent hearing may examine any party appearing in person or present in court or any person able to answer any material questions relating to the suit by whom such party or his pleader is accompanied. Under Order X Rule 14 the court may of its own motion summon as a witness any person including the party to the suit for examination and the said rule is under the caption ?Court may of its own accord summon as witnesses strangers to suit? and Order XVIII Rule 17 empowers the court to recall any witness who has been examined and may subject to Law of Evidence for the time being in force put such questions to him as it thinks fit. The powers of the court under this Rule 17 are discretionary and very wide.
15. Besides the above specific provisions under the CrPC and CPC empowering the criminal and civil courts as the case may be, to summon and examine witnesses, a judge in order to discover or to obtain proof of relevant facts is empowered under Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act to exercise all the privileges and powers subject to the proviso to that section which power he has under the Evidence Act. Section 540 of the old Code (Section 311 of the new Code) and Section 165 of the Evidence Act may be said to be complementary to each other and as observed by this Court in Jamatraj Kewalji Govani v. State Of Maharashtra 1967 3 SCR 415 ?these two sections between them confer jurisdiction on the judge to act in aid of justice?.
16. The second part of Section 540 as pointed out albeit imposes upon the court an obligation of summoning or recalling and re-examining any witness and the only condition prescribed is that the evidence sought to be obtained must be essential to the just decision of the case. When any party to the proceedings points out the desirability of some evidence being taken, then the court has to exercise its power under this provision ? either discretionary or mandatory ? depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, having in view that the most paramount principle underlying this provision is to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts in order to meet the requirements of justice. In this connection we would like to quote with approval the following views of Lumpkin, J. in Epps v. S.2, which reads thus:
?? it is not only the right but the duty of the presiding judge to call the attention of the witness to it, whether it makes for or against the prosecution; his aim being neither to punish the innocent nor screen the guilty, but to administer the law correctly ?. Counsel seek only for their client's success; but the judge must watch that justice triumphs.?
17. The law is clearly expounded in the case of Jamatraj Kewalji Govani (referred to above) wherein Hidayatullah, J. as he then was, while speaking for the bench about the unfettered discretionary power of the court as envisaged under section 540 of the code has stated thus: (SCR pp. 422-23)
?It is difficult to limit the power under our Code to cases which involve something arising ex-improviso which no human ingenuity could foresee, in the course of the defence. Our Code does not make this a condition of the exercise of the power and it is not right to embark on judicial legislation. Cases that go far are of course not quite right. Indeed they could be decided on fact because it can always be seen whether the new matter is strictly necessary for a just decision and not intended to give an unfair advantage to one of the rival sides ?.
? It would appear that in our criminal jurisdiction, statutory law confers a power in absolute terms to be exercised at any stage of the trial to summon a witness or examine one present in court or to recall a witness already examined, and makes this the duty and obligation of the court provided the just decision of the case demands it. In other words, where the court exercises the power under the second part, the inquiry cannot be whether the accused has brought anything suddenly or unexpectedly but whether the court is right in thinking that the new evidence is needed by it for a just decision of the case. If the court has acted without the requirements of a just decision, the action is open to criticism but if the court's action is supportable as being in aid of a just decision the action cannot be regarded as exceeding the jurisdiction.?
18. The next important question is whether Section 540 gives the court carte blanche drawing no underlying principle in the exercise of the extraordinary power and whether the said section is unguided, uncontrolled and uncanalised. Though Section 540 (Section 311 of the new Code) is, in the widest possible terms and calls for no limitation, either with regard to the stage at which the powers of the court should be exercised, or with regard to the manner in which they should be exercised, that power is circumscribed by the principle that underlines Section 540, namely, evidence to be obtained should appear to the court essential to a just decision of the case by getting at the truth by all lawful means. Therefore, it should be borne in mind that the aid of the section should be invoked only with the object of discovering relevant facts or obtaining proper proof of such facts for a just decision of the case and it must be used judicially and not capriciously or arbitrarily because any improper or capricious exercise of the power may lead to undesirable results. Further it is incumbent that due care should be taken by the court while exercising the power under this section and it should not be used for filling up the lacuna left by the prosecution or by the defence or to the disadvantage of the accused or to cause serious prejudice to the defence of the accused or to give an unfair advantage to the rival side and further the additional evidence should not be received as a disguise for a retrial or to change the nature of the case against either of the parties.
19. Fazal Ali, J. in Rameshwar Dayal v. State of U.P 1978 2 SCC 518 while expressing his views about the careful exercise of its power by the court has stated: (SCC pp. 524 and 526, paras 12 and 16)
?It is true that under Section 540 of the Criminal Procedure Code the High Court has got very wide powers to examine any witness it likes for the just decision of the case, but this power has to be exercised sparingly and only when the ends of justice so demand. The higher the power the more careful should be its exercise ?.
The words, ?just decision of the case? would become meaningless and without any significance if a decision is to be arrived at without a sense of justice and fair play.?
20. In State Of West Bengal v. Tulsidas Mundhra . 1963 Supp 1 SCR 1, it has observed: (SCR pp. 8-9)
?It would be noticed that this section confers on criminal courts very wide powers. It is no doubt for the court to consider whether its power under this section should be exercised or not. But if it is satisfied that the evidence of any person not examined or further evidence of any person already examined is essential to the just decision of the case, it is its duty to take such evidence. The exercise of the power conferred by Section 540 is conditioned by the requirement that such exercise would be essential to the just decision of the case.?
21. At the risk of repetition it may be said that Section 540 allows the court to invoke its inherent power at any stage, as long as the court retains seisin of the criminal proceeding, without qualifying any limitation or prohibition. Needless to say that an enquiry or trial in a criminal proceeding comes to an end or reaches its finality when the order or judgment is pronounced and until then the court has power to use this section. The answer to the question like the one that has arisen in the present case is whether the court would be justified in exercising its power under Section 540 is found in Kewalji case. In that case the appellant was prosecuted on two counts under Section 135(a) and (b) of the Customs Act. The appellant did not lead any evidence on his behalf but filed a written statement, claiming inter alia that no offence had been disclosed against him, since no witness had deposed that the contraband had been seized from him under the Act in the reasonable belief that they were smuggled goods. The day after the statement was filed the prosecution applied for examination of the customs officer who was in charge of the search as a court witness in the interest of justice. The Magistrate ordered the examination of the officer under section 540 of the code rejecting the objections raised by the appellant. Though an opportunity was given to the appellant to lead defence evidence, the appellant stated that he had nothing further to add and no evidence to lead. The trial court convicted the appellant who being aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court preferred an appeal to the High Court which dismissed the appeal. Before this Court it was contended that the evidence of the officer was improperly received. That contention has been repelled by this Court observing: (SCR pp. 420-21 & 424)
?This power is exercisable at any time and the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly so states? and thereafter concluded ?it cannot be said that the court had exceeded its jurisdiction in acting under the second part of section 540 of the code of Criminal Procedure.?
22. Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the bench in Tulsidas Mundhra has pointed out as follows: (SCR pp. 9-10)
?Section 540 in terms applies at any stage of any enquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code. This section is wide enough to include a proceeding under Section 207-A and so, it would be unreasonable to contend that the scheme of Section 207-A makes Section 540 inapplicable to the proceedings governed by Section 207-A. The power of the court under Section 540 can be exercised as much in regard to casesgoverned by Section 207-A as in regard to other proceedings governed by the other relevant provisions of the Code.?
(It may be noted that section 207-a of the old code in Chapter XVIII under the caption ?Enquiry into casestriable by the Court of Session or the High Court? dealt with the procedures to be adopted in proceedings instituted on police report and this provision is omitted in the new Code.)
23. This Court in Kewalji case held that Chapter XXI of CrPC (old) (under the heading ?Of the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates?) does not restrict the powers of criminal court under Section 540.
24. In Masalti v. State of U.P AIR 1965 SC 202 wherein the defence did not opt to examine some witnesses who have been left out by the prosecution on the bona fide belief that those witnesses had been won over and the court also after due deliberation refused to exercise its power under Section 540; this Court while examining a submission that the trial court should have exercised its power under Section 540 and examined those witnesses expressed its opinion that ?that is one aspect of the matter which we have to take into account? ? that is in considering whether the accused were prejudiced or not.
25. It has been held by this Court in Rajeswar Prosad Misra v. State of W.B 1966 1 SCR 178 while dealing with the ample power and jurisdiction of the court in taking additional evidence as follows: (SCR pp. 187-88)
?Additional evidence may be necessary for a variety of reasons which it is hardly necessary (even if it was possible) to list here. We do not propose to do what the legislature has refrained from doing, namely, to control discretion of the appellate court to certain stated circumstances. It may, however, be said that additional evidence must be necessary not because it would be impossible to pronounce judgment but because there would be failure of justice without it. The power must be exercised sparingly and only in suitable cases. Once such action is justified, there is no restriction on the kind of evidence which may be received. It may be formal or substantial.?
26. The above view has been reiterated in R.B Mithani v. State of Maharashtra 1971 1 SCC 523.
27. The principle of law that emerges from the views expressed by this Court in the above decisions is that the criminal court has ample power to summon any person as a witness or recall and re-examine any such person even if the evidence on both sides is closed and the jurisdiction of the court must obviously be dictated by exigency of the situation, and fair play and good sense appear to be the only safe guides and that only the requirements of justice command the examination of any person which would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
28. What falls for determination now is whether the person indicted should be given an opportunity to rebut the evidence of the witness or witnesses summoned and examined under Section 540. This question came for determination in Rameshwar Dayal case and this Court answered that question thus: (SCC pp. 525-26, paras 15 and 16)
?It was argued by counsel for the State that there is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code which requires the court to allow the appellant an opportunity to rebut the evidence of witnesses summoned under Section 540 CrPC. This argument, in our opinion, is based on a serious misconception of the correct approach to the cardinal principles of criminal justice. Section 540 itself incorporates a rule of natural justice. The accused is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. It is, therefore, manifest that where any fresh evidence is admitted against the accused the presumption of innocence is weakened and the accused in all fairness should be given an opportunity to rebut that evidence. The right to adduce evidence in rebuttal is one of the inevitable steps in the defence of a case by the accused and a refusal of the same amounts not only to an infraction of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code but also of the principles of natural justice and offends the famous maxim audi alteram partem ?.
A careful perusal of this provision manifestly reveals that the statute has armed the court with all the powers to do full justice between the parties as full justice cannot be done until both the parties are properly heard the condition of giving an opportunity to the accused to rebut any fresh evidence sought to be adduced against him either at the trial or the appellate stage appears to us to be implicit under Section 540 of the CrPC.?
29. See also Kewalji case. This was the view taken by various High Courts such as in Channu Lal v. Rex AIR 1949 All 692, Rengaswami Naicker v. Muruga Naicker AIR 1954 Mad 169, Shugan Chand v. Emperor AIR 1925 Lab 531 and Queen v. Assanoollah 13 SWR Cri 15.
30. The views expressed in the above judgments of the various High Courts have been approved by this Court in Rameshwar Dayal case. We are in full agreement with the above view of Fazal Ali, J. and hold that whenever any additional evidence is examined or fresh evidence is admitted against the accused, it is absolutely necessary in the interest of justice that the accused should be afforded a fair and reasonable opportunity to rebut that evidence brought on record against him.
31. With this legal background let us now turn to the challenge posed by the appellant in these appeals. The trial court and the first revision court rejected the request of the prosecution on three grounds, namely, first that the prosecution has attempted to fabricate evidence at a belated stage to fill up the lacuna in the prosecution case and secondly that the request of the prosecution for taking additional evidence was after the closure of the defence and thirdly a substantial prejudice would be caused to the appellant if the prosecution is allowed to adduce fresh evidence. As pointed out by the High Court in its impugned order, gold, silver and ornaments of the value of Rs 8,48,482 and currency notes of Rs 79,000 have been seized from the premises, searched on the strength of the search warrant issued by Shri K.K Das. What the appellant now contends is that the order of the High Court permitting the prosecution to recall one of the witnesses already examined and to summon two other new witnesses to prove the foreign markings on the lagadis is in violation of the principle underlying Section 540. We waded through the entire records inclusive of the copies of depositions, search warrant and the application filed by the prosecution under Section 540 which are available in the file, forwarded by the High Court though those documents are not annexed with the SLP. The prosecution filed the petition for examination of the three witnesses stating that foreign ingots (lagadis) have been seized from the possession of the appellant and that warrant for search of the premises of the appellant/accused was issued in this regard by the Assistant Collector of Customs, namely Shri K.K Das and hence fresh evidence is necessary for a just decision of the case. After perusing the depositions of the witnesses already examined that are found on the file, we think that the appellant/accused cannot be said to be prejudiced in any way by examination of these three witnesses. PW 2 who was then working as Superintendent of Customs in the office of the Assistant Collector of Customs at Adipur during the relevant period has stated that Shri K.K Das who was the then Assistant Collector of Customs issued the warrant dated September 7, 1971 authorising Shri Mirchandani, Superintendent of Customs, Adipur to search for the prohibited and dutiable goods and documents in the premises mentioned in the warrant. It is elicited from the same witness in the cross-examination that the gold ornaments were seized since the seizing authority doubted that they are smuggled gold and procured by contravening the Gold Control Act. It is seen from the evidence of PW 3 that he and others inclusive of Superintendent Mirchandani went to the house of the appellant and they seized the gold ornaments dhalia, that is, primary gold under panchnama and search list Exs. 24 and 25. Therefore, the appellant's grievance that he has been taken by surprise on the request of the prosecution for taking fresh evidence; that the evidence sought to be obtained is only for filling up the lacuna and the judgment impugned is prejudicial to him cannot be countenanced. Of the three witnesses permitted to be summoned and examined on the side of the Union of India, the Mint Master is only an assayer. In our considered opinion, the facts and circumstances of the case require the examination of these three witnesses for a just decision of the case as held by the High Court.
32. In the light of the proposition of law which we have derived in the preceding portion of the judgment there is no illegality in summoning the witnesses after the closure of the defence arguments. It is seen from the order of the trial court that the argument of the prosecution has not yet begun. Since we feel that any further observation of ours in justification of this order may prejudice the defence of the appellant before the trial court, we are not inclined to discuss the evidence any further.
33. A decision of this Court in Mir Mohd. Omar v. State of W.B 1989 4 SCC 436 was relied upon to show that after the examination of the accused under Section 313 of the new Code (corresponding to Section 342 of the old Code) the prosecution should not move the trial Judge for recalling a witness already examined, but the observation made in that decision has no application to the present case because in that case the said observation was made in a different context by this Court while examining the plea of the prosecution in making corrections of the evidence already recorded under section 272 of the code and that decision does not deal with the ambit of section 540 of the code.
34. The other contention raised on behalf of the appellant is that the order of the Magistrate rejecting the application of the prosecution under Section 540 is not a revisable order under Section 397(1) as it being an interlocutory order and even if it is not so, the second revision by the same party ? i.e Union of India is not entertainable in view of the statutory bar under Section 397(3) of the new Code as the Union of India has already availed the revision under Section 397(2) before the Sessions Judge. We may straightway reject this plea on the simple ground that the prosecution in the present case was launched under the old Code and as such only the provisions of the old Code have to be applied as per Section 484 of the new Code. The fervent plea of the appellant is though the prosecution was instituted under the old Code he should not be denied the benefit and advantage of Section 397(2) and (",1
"?	1. The Trial Court has passed a decree for possession of property bearing No. R-719, New Rajinder Nagar, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the ""suit property""), against the appellant under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is under challenge in this appeal.
?	The respondent further notified the appellant to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property on or before 15 July, 2009.
?	6. On 22 September, 2009, the respondent instituted a suit for recovery of possession and mesne profits against the appellant in respect of the suit property before the Trial Court.
?	The appellant also challenged the title of the respondent and pleaded that the respondent was neither the co-owner nor had any right, title or interest in the suit property.
?	7. On 3rd May, 2010, the respondent filed an application under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the Trial Court seeking a decree on admissions.
?	The learned Trial Court allowed the aforesaid application and passed the decree for possession which is under challenge in this appeal.
?	The appellant has disputed the title of the respondent and has urged that the dispute between the respondent and the other co-owners of the suit is pending before the Court.
?	It is submitted that there is a legal presumption of service under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1892 and Section 114(f) of the India Evidence Act, 1872, and the denial of notice by the appellant is of no avail.
?	A 'tenant at sufferance' is one who wrongfully continues in possession after the extinction of his lawful term and has been described as the least and lowest interest which can subsist in realty and is merely a legal fiction or device to avoid continuance in possession from operating as a trespass.
?	The tenant at sufferance is one who wrongfully continues in possession after the extinction of a lawful title.
?	It cannot be created by contract and arises only by implication of law when a person who has been in possession under a lawful title continues in possession after that title has been determined, without the consent of the person entitled.
?	We are of the opinion that mere acceptance of rent by the landlord, the first respondent herein, from the tenant in possession after the lease has been determined either by efflux of time or by notice to quit would not create a tenancy so as to confer on the erstwhile tenant the status of a tenant or a right to be in possession...""
?	Section 27 of the General Clauses Act incorporates a presumption of law.
?	It provides that in considering whether common course of business had been followed or not, the Court shall also have regard to such facts as are set out in relation to each of the illustrations.

?	It is said that the function of a presumption often is to ""fill a gap"" in evidence.
?	31. In Har Charan Singh v. Shiv Rani, AIR 1981 SC 1284, the Supreme Court held that a presumption of service can be drawn under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Section 114(f) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
?	It would be reasonable to hold that when service is effected by refusal of a postal communication the addressee must be imputed, with the knowledge of the contents thereof and in our view, this follows upon the presumptions that are raised under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act.""
?	32. In Madan and Co. v. Wazir Jaivir Chand, AIR 1989 SC 630, the Supreme Court held that a notice sent by registered post is presumed to have been delivered to the addressee under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act.
?	Section 114 enables the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
?	We have no hesitation to hold that no notice to quit was necessary under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act in order to enable the respondent to get a decree of eviction against the appellant.""
?	In view of the decision in the case of Nopany (supra) I hold that even assuming the notice terminating tenancy was not served upon the Appellant (though it has been served and as held by me above) the tenancy would stand terminated on filing of the subject suit against the appellant/defendant.
?	In my opinion the argument that the tenancy has not been validly terminated, and the suit could not have been filed, fails for this reason also.
?	The intention of Legislature is clear that technical objections should not be permitted to defeat substantial justice and the suit for possession of tenanted premises once the tenant has a period of 15 days for vacating the tenanted premises.
?	Even if we take this date when the appellant/tenant received a copy of the notice when served with the documents in the suit, once again, the period of 15 days has expired thereafter and keeping the legislative intendment of amended Section 106 in view, the appellant cannot argue that the tenancy is not terminated and he did not get a period of 15 days to vacate the premises.
?	I am in view of this position entitled to take notice of subsequent events under Order 7 Rule 7 CPC, and taking notice of the subsequent events of the expiry of 15 days after receipt of a copy of the notice alongwith documents in the suit, I hold that the tenancy has been validly terminated, and as on date, the appellant/tenant has no right to stay in the premises and the decree for possession was rightly passed by the trial Court.
?	39. In Rabinder Nath Saha v. Sushma Jain, 182 (2011) DLT 456, this Court following the decision in Jeevan Diesel (supra) noted that the SLP against the judgment of Jeevan Diesel (supra) was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 7 July, 2011.
?	""The only dispute which the appellant has been raising in the appeal is that he has never admitted in the written statement with respect to service of notice upon him under Section 106, T.P Act and the order of the learned Trial Court thereby presuming the service upon the appellant is bad in law.
?	The Court is of the considered opinion that law as relied upon by the learned Trial Court with respect to presuming the service upon the appellant, does not suffer from any legal infirmity or illegality.""
?	The Court is required to consider that if a suit for possession is filed without serving a notice under Section 106 of the Act, can such a suit be decreed.
?	The language of Section 106 of the Act before its amendment provided a fertile ground for the litigants and lawyers to contest suits on this technical ground that the tenancy was not validly terminated by means of a notice expiring with the end of tenancy month.
?	Every tenant by virtue of amended Section 106 of the Act is put to notice that in case the landlord is legally entitled to ask the tenant to vacate the premises, the tenant shall vacate the premises as long as the tenant has a 15 days notice period to vacate the tenanted premises.
?	The technical rule has been whittled down by a catena of judgments of the Supreme Court whereby the Supreme Court has said that Courts are always empowered to take notice of subsequent events under Order 7 Rule 7 CPC to shorten the litigation.
?	The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the object of taking notice of subsequent events is to shorten the litigation and to do substantive justice.
?	This principle of taking notice of subsequent events is a well settled principle and I need not burden this judgment with the innumerable judgments of the Supreme Court on this aspect.
?	Even if the notice by which tenancy is terminated prior to the filing of the suit is held to be invalid, then, in my opinion, service of summons of the suit for eviction of the tenant showing the categorical intention of the landlord asking the tenant to vacate the tenanted premises can be taken as a notice under Section 106 of the Act read with Order 7 Rule 7 CPC.
?	43. In Shri Ram Pasricha v. Jagannath, AIR 1976 SC 2335, the Supreme Court held that in a suit for eviction, the tenant is estopped from questioning the title of landlord.
?	It is inconceivable to throw out the suit on account of non-pleading of other co-owners as such.""
?	Once a lease stands forfeited by operation of law, the person in occupation of the premises cannot take benefit of the legal tenancy.
?	52. In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, 2012 (3) SCALE 550, the Supreme Court held that the person resisting a claim for recovery of possession or claiming a right to continue in possession has to establish that he has such a right.
?	The factors which deserve to be taken into consideration in order to enable the Court to pass a decree in plaintiff's favor as regards possession in such like suit.
?	In case the lessee claims a right of renewal under a clause he must bring a separate suit for specific performance of the renewal clause within the limitation prescribed for such a suit. ...
?	55. In Jindal Dyechem Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Pahwa International Pvt. Ltd., 2009 (113) DRJ 214, this Court held that a notice dispatched to the defendant by registered post is presumed to be served under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act and a denial of the said notice by the defendant has no value.
?	The Court passed a decree for possession under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
?	The Court held the material to be sufficient to draw a presumption of proper service under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.
?	The materials are sufficient for the Court to draw an inference of proper service, based on Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, and the judgment of the Supreme Court, in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan, 1999 (7) SCC 510...""
?	The denial of service of notice shall be treated as a vague denial and deemed to have been admitted.""
?	The thrust of amendment is that in an appropriate case a party on the admission of the other party can press for judgment as a matter of legal right.
?	58. In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, (supra), the Supreme Court held that false claims and defences are serious problems with real estate litigation, predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate.
?	84. False claims and defences are really serious problems with real estate litigation, predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate.
?	Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount.
?	59. In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P, (2010) 2 SCC 114, the Supreme Court observed that a new creed of litigants have cropped up in the last 40 years who do not have any respect for truth and shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals.
?	62. In Mohammad Ahmad v. Atma Ram Chauhan, (2011) 7 SCC 755, the Supreme Court observed that the motivation of the tenant to litigate with the landlord is that he doesn't want to pay the prevalent market rate of rent to the landlord and continues to pay the rent fixed years ago.
?	63. In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra), the Supreme Court held that inherent interest to continue frivolous litigation by unscrupulous litigants would be reduced to a large extent, if continuation of possession is permitted upon payment of market rent.
?	In case while granting or refusing injunction, the Court properly considers pleadings and documents and takes the pragmatic view and grants appropriate mesne profit, then the inherent interest to continue frivolous litigation by unscrupulous litigants would be reduced to a large extent.
?	The findings of the Supreme Court are as under:-
?	It is the bounden duty of the court to ensure that dishonesty and any attempt to abuse the legal process must be effectively curbed and the court must ensure that there is no wrongful, unauthorised or unjust gain for anyone by the abuse of the process of the court.
?	The court while rendering justice must adopt a pragmatic approach and in appropriate cases realistic costs and compensation be ordered in order to discourage dishonest litigation.
?	(7) Litigation should not be permitted to turn into a fruitful industry so that the unscrupulous litigants are encouraged to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.
?	The Court in the case of Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi, (2011) 8 SCC 249 (of which one of us, Bhandari, J. was the author of the judgment) in paragraph 52(C, D and G) of the judgment dealt with the aspect of imposition of actual or realistic costs which are equally relevant for this case...""
?	67. In Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi, (2011) 8 SCC 249, the Supreme Court has held that the Courts have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and have to be realistic in imposing the costs.
?	""45. ........We are clearly of the view that unless we ensure that wrongdoers are denied profit or undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for litigations.
?	In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation.
?	The courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.
?	55. The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how long the Defendants or Respondents were compelled to contest and defend the litigation in various courts.
?	The Appellants in the instant case have harassed the Respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in various courts.
?	The appeals are dismissed with costs, which we quantify as Rs.
?	68. In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra) the Supreme Court held that heavy costs and prosecution should be ordered in cases of false claims and defences as under:-
?	The Court in a recent judgment in Ramrameshwari Devi (supra) aptly observed at page 266 that unless wrongdoers are denied profit from frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to prevent it.
?	The petitioners are liable to pay costs which is equivalent to the average market rent of 292 months to the Respondent No. 1 and which comes to Rs.
?	Before parting with the case, I consider it necessary to pen down that one of the reasons for over-flowing of court dockets is the frivolous litigation in which the Courts are engaged by the litigants and which is dragged as long as possible.
?	It becomes the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong doers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in prolonging the litigation due to their money power, ultimately they must suffer the costs of all these years long litigation.
?	It is necessary that I strictly apply the ratio of the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Ram Rameshwari Devi (supra)....""
?	Dishonest and unnecessary litigations are a huge strain on the judicial system which is asked to spend unnecessary time for such litigation.
?	""On hearing Mr. Dhruv Mehta, Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, and on going through the judgment of the High Court, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court.
?	The special leave petition is dismissed.""
?	(supra), the Supreme Court held that truth should be a guiding star in entire legal process.
?	It is a well accepted and settled principle that a Court must discharge its statutory functions-whether discretionary or obligatory-according to law in dispensing justice because it is the duty of a Court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is being done.
?	Truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue.
?	In United States v. J. Lee Havens, 446 U.S 620, 100 St.Ct 1912, it was held that the government may use illegally obtained evidence to impeach a defendant's fraudulent statements during cross-examination for the purpose of seeking justice, for the purpose of ""arriving at the truth, which is a fundamental goal of our legal system"".
?	74. If the pleadings do not give sufficient details, they will not raise an issue, and the Court can reject the claim or pass a decree on admission.
?	2. Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether it is pleadings, affidavits or evidence.
?	86. A self-serving denial by the defendant and more so in these types of cases, cannot hold back the Court from exercising its jurisdiction to decree a suit under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
?	Raising a plea of non-receipt of notice to quit and seeking an issue on it is obviously to drag on the litigation and keep on holding to the suit property without having to pay the current market rentals, is not sufficient to raise an issue and liable to be rejected.
?	The Court cannot remain a silent spectator and allow the abuse of process of law.
?	Even if the notice of termination is held to be invalid, service of summons of the suit for possession can be taken as notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act read with Order VII Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure but in that event the landlord would be entitled to mesne profits after the expiry of 15 days from the date of the receipt of summons and not from the date of notice of termination.
?	99. Truth should be the guiding star in the entire judicial process and it must be the endeavour of the court to ascertain the truth in every matter.
?	The Court can also invoke Section 30 of the Code of Civil Procedure to ascertain the truth.
?	100. Unless the Courts ensure that wrongdoers are denied profit or undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for litigations.
?	It becomes the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong doers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in prolonging the litigation, ultimately they must suffer the costs.
?	The cost should be equal to the benefits derived by the litigants, and the harm and deprivation suffered by the rightful person so as to check the frivolous litigations and prevent the people from reaping a rich harvest of illegal acts through Court.
?	In the written statement before the learned Trial Court, the appellant has admitted the registered lease deed dated 7 November, 2006 between the parties, which expired on 6 November, 2008.
?	Self serving denial by the defendant and more so in this type of case, cannot hold back the Court from exercising its jurisdiction to decree the suit under Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
?	104. Even assuming that the notice of termination was not served upon the appellant, though there is legal presumption of since as held above, the tenancy stood terminated on the filing of the suit in terms of the judgments of the Supreme Court in Nopany Investments (P) Ltd. v. Santokh Singh (HUF) (supra) and of this Court in Jeevan Diesels & Electricals Ltd. v. Jasbir Singh Chadha (HUF) (supra), Rabinder Nath Saha v. Sushma Jain (supra) and Shri Radhakrishan Temple Trust Maithan, Agra v. Hindco Rotatron Pvt. Ltd., (supra) .
?	106. The appellant's plea disputing the title of the respondent is barred by Section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act.
?	107. The appellant's lease also stands forfeited under Section 111(g)(2) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 on account of renunciation of his character by setting up a title in a third person.
?	The appellant has taken the suit property from the respondent alone and the notice of termination by the respondent is legal and valid.
?	Vide order dated 18 March, 2003, this Court in Suit No. 941/2002 has restrained the respondent from letting out of the suit property to a new tenant after the appellant vacates the same but there is no restraint on the respondent receiving back the possession.
?	The Managing Director on oath admitted that the appellant took the suit property on lease for a period of two years from the respondent and the lease was renewed for a period of two years in 2004 and again in 2006.
?	The appellant has no right to stay in the suit property and the decree of possession has been rightly passed by the Trial Court.
?	113. the case warrants imposition of costs on the appellant in terms of the judgments of the Supreme Court in Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi (supra) and Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra) and of this Court in Punjab National Bank v. Virender Prakash (supra) and Padmawati v. Harijan Sewak Sangh (supra).
?	The appellant failed in its statutory obligation and continued the possession, whereupon the respondent sent a notice of termination to the appellant on 20 June, 2009.
?	The Trial Court passed the decree against the appellant on 17 August, 2010 but still the appellant was not ready to surrender and filed this appeal raising frivolous grounds.
?	115. It is the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong doers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in prolonging the litigation, ultimately they must suffer the costs of all these years long litigation.
?	The appellant has no respect for truth and has made false statements on oath.
?	The appellant has shamelessly resorted to falsehood and has attempted to pollute the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands and the appellant is not entitled to any relief.
?	The appeal is dismissed with costs of R

"?	It can be done by making necessary endorsement in the same document or by creating another document .
?	So the execution of the second document is also in the form of reordering or rearranging or redrafting or even varying the transaction covered by the first document in favour of the defacto complainant, which also can be done by creating or executing a different document .
?	(b) (i) of any offence punishable under any of the following Sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), namely Sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, or
?	except on the complaint in writing of that Court or by such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.
?	21.? In the context of A1 to A3 filing the suit and obtaining interim injunction basing upon the alleged forged sale deed in question, it is necessary to deliberate whether the production of the document in the civil suit for the purpose of recording relevant evidence or recording the evidence would debar the complainant from filing the corresponding charge sheet or when once it was filed, it would render the charge sheet not maintainable in view of the provisions encompassed in clause (1)(b)(ii) of Section 195 Cr.P.C.
?	The sub-section puts the condition that before the court makes a complaint of ""any offence referred to in clause (b) of Section 195(1)"" the Court has to follow the procedure laid down in Section 340 Cr.P.C.
?	No complaint can be made by a court regarding any offence falling within the ambit of Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C. without first adopting those procedural requirements.
?	There is no dispute before us that if forgery has been committed while the document was in the custody of a Court, then prosecution can be launched only with a complaint made by that court.
?	There is also no dispute that if forgery was committed with a document which has not been produced in a court then the prosecution would lie at the instance of any person.
?	'The offences about which the court alone, to the exclusion of the aggrieved private parties, is clothed with the right to complain may be appropriately considered to be only those offences committed by a party to a proceeding in that court, the commission of which has a reasonably close nexus with the proceedings in that court so that it can, without embarking upon a completely independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider by reference principally to its records the expediency of prosecuting the delinquent party.
?	It appears to us to be more appropriate to adopt the strict construction of confining the prohibition contained in S. 195(1)(c) only to those cases in which the offences specified therein were committed by a party to the proceeding in the character as such party.""
?	The question of filing relevant charge sheet would not arise at all by consequence of which, no court has to take cognizance of the charge sheet filed without adequate material to constitute a particular offence or particular offences.
?	Any argument that the factors, which relate to the question of ownership of a property should be tried before a Civil Court only is nothing but misconception.
?	Suppose there is a question as to whether an accused trespassed into a property, the ownership or legal possession of which is in dispute without determining that factor or those factors while conducting the investigation of the case collecting relevant documentary evidence, the question of prosecuting the accused is to be ruled out.
?	"" in view of the above, the law on the issue stands crystallized to the effect that the findings of fact recorded by the Civil Court do not have any bearing so far as the criminal case is concerned and vice-versa.
?	27.? the Supreme Court comprehensively held that the findings of fact recorded by a Civil Court would not have any bearing so far as the criminal case is concerned and vice-versa where standard of proof is different and there is neither any statutory nor any legal principle that the findings recorded by the Court either in civil or criminal proceedings shall be binding between the same parties while dealing with the same subject matter where both the cases are to be decided on the basis of evidence adduced therein subject to the exceptions noted.

"Advocates Appeared:
N. V. Gandhi, for the Petitioner.
None for Respondent No. 1.
Ms. Sangeeta Pahwa, for M/s. Thakkar Associates, for Respondent No. 2.
Ms. SONIA GOKANI, J. The petitioner is the original plaintiff who preferred HRP suit no. 352 of 2007 before the small cause court Ahmedabad for declaration to an effect that he be declared tenant of the suit premises seeking further direction of restraining the defendants from interfering with the peaceful possession and dispossessing him from the suit premises without following the due process of law
2. The initial grant of the order of status quo came to be subsequently vacated, which was however continued to enable the petitioner to approach the higher forum.
3. Being aggrieved by such an order, the petitioner preferred an Appeal from Order no. 82 of 2007 before the Appellate Bench Small Cause Court, Ahmedabad, wherein the Appellate Bench vide its order dated 28th February 2008 dismissed the Appeal. Such an order has been challenged by way of the present petition enumerating various grounds for such a challenge.
4. It is the say of the petitioner that the Bungalow no. 12 of Pahelgav Bungalows of Premdeep Co- Operative Housing Society Limited was let out to the petitioner as tenant by the respondent no. 1 through the respondent no. 2 at monthly rent of Rs. 5000/-; excluding taxes and maintenance of the Society with a deposit of an amount of Rs. 50,000/- on 1st July 2001 and the petitioner and his family members are in physical possession of the suit premises till the date. The sister of the petitioner is also running a Beauty Saloon; the respondent no. 1 is residing abroad and the respondent no. 2 is the administrator and rent collector, collects the rent from the petitioner from the time the same has been rented to him.
5. It is the say of the petitioner that the respondent no. 2 is not issuing the rent receipts and that the rent has been paid till 31st December 2006 and in January 2007, the respondent no. 2 refused to accept the rent and demanded higher rent of Rs. per month.
6. Learned senior advocate Shri Sunit Shah appearing with Mr. N.V. Gandhi vehemently made his submissions by emphasizing the facts that the petitioner is in a continued settled legal possession. He further submitted that both the courts below have erred in not appreciating the fact that the respondent stay across the street and the petitioner runs a beauty salon and therefore, inference needs to be drawn that the respondents would be aware of the settled legal possession. He relied upon the following decisions in support of his submissions;-
(a) In case of Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernanades & Ors. v. Erasmo Jack De Sequeria (Dead) Through L.Rs., reported in 2012 STPL (Web) 181 SC;
(b) In case of Wander Limited & Anr. v. Antrox India P. Limited, reported in 1990 (Suppl) SCC 727;
(c) In case of Premji Ratansey Shah & Ors. v. Union of India, reported in 1994 (5) SCC 547];
(d) In case of Rame Gowda (dade) by Lrs. Vs. M. Varadappa Naidu (dead) by Lrs. & Anr., reported in (2004) 1 SCC 769.
(e) In case of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited v. Sriman Narayan & Anr., reported in 2002 (5) SCC 760;
6.1 He accordingly urged that this settled legal possession of the petitioner shall need to be protected by this court.
6.2 Learned advocate Ms. Sangeeta Pahva urged that there is no agreement nor any tenancy document nor any lease and even not a single document of the rent receipt on the record of the matter. She further urged that there is not a single document to hold the possession in favour of the petitioner. Again, she urged that this court is not required to entertain this petition as there is no error or illegality could cause grave injustice to the present petitioner.
7. As can be noted, the learned Single Judge as well as the appellate bench of Small Cause Court both chose not to protect the possession of the petitioner on the ground that though the plaintiff petitioner is in physical possession of the property but he poorly failed to establish that he possesses the property as a lawful tenant, in absence of any evidence showing the tenancy of suit premises. The documentary evidence produced at the most lead to suggest according to the Courts that he was having possession of the suit premises but such documents where not sufficient to protect him under the provisions of Bombay Rent Act.
8. It would be worthwhile to make a mention of the judgment sought to be relied upon rendered in the case of Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes and others Vs. Erasmo Jack De Sequeria (dead) through L.RS. [Supra]. In this decision, reference is made of various decisions, as to be discussed hereinafter.
9. In case of Rame Gowda (dead) by Lrs. Vs. M. Varadappa Naidu (dead) by Lrs. & Anr. reported in 2004 (1) SCC 769, it has been observed by the Bench of three judges of the Apex Court that the plea of possession is no good against the rightful owner and assumption that the person is in peaceful possession will not work and cannot operate against the true lawful owner. Yet another decision rendered in case of Southern Roadways Ltd., Madurai Vs. S.M. Krishnan, reported in 1989 (4) SCC 603 has been referred, wherein the Supreme Court held that, it is the settled law that agent has no possession of his own and care takers possession is the possession of the principal . Reference is also made to the decision of Supreme Court in case of Anima Mallick Vs. Ajoy Kumar Roy and Anr., 2000 (4) SCC 119, where the sister gave possession gratuitously to the brother and the Court restored possession to the sister as it was purely on gratuitous basis holding that the sister could have reclaimed possession even without knowledge of the brother.
10. Case laws of Automobile Products India Limited Vs. Das John peter and Others 2010 (12) SCC 593 and Ramrameshwari devi and Others Vs. Nirmala Devi and Others (2011) 8 SCC 249 are discussed where the Apex Court has held that dilatory tactics, misconceived injunction suits create incentives for wrongdoers and held that, ""truth alone has to be the foundation of justice. The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and find out the real truth. Judges at all levels have to seriously engaged themselves in a journey of discovering the truth. Thatl is their mandate, obligation and bounden duty. The judicial system will acquire credibility only when people will be convinced that justice is based on the foundation of the truth."" Decision also referred to relied upon is of Mohanlal Shamji Soni Vs. Union of India, 1991 Supp. (1) SCC 271, where the Supreme Court reiterated need of discovering truth in every matter and deliver the parties their due they deserve in these words, "".. It is a well accepted and settled principle that a Court must discharge its statutory functions-whether discretionary or obligatory-according to law in dispensing justice because it is the duty of a Court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is being done. What people expect is that the court should discharge its obligation to find out where in fact the truth lies. Right from inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice"".
11. Apex Court in case of Ritesh Tewari and another Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., 2010 (10) SCC 677, has quoted often quoted quotation, which reads thus-
""Every trial is voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest""
and held that, "".. It would be imperative that one who claims possession must give all such details as enumerated hereunder. They are only illustrative and not exhaustive.
(a) Who is or are the owner of the property;
(b) Title of the property;
(c) Who is in possession of the title documents
(d) identity of the claimant or claimants to possession;
(e) The date of entry into possession;
(f) how he came into possession-whether he purchased the property ' or inherited or got the same in gift or by any other method;
(g) In case he purchased the property, what is the consideration; if he has taken it on rent, how much is the rent, license fee or lease amount;
(h) If taken on rent, license fee or lease-then insist on rent deed, license deed or lease deed;
(I) who are the persons in possession/occupation or otherwise living with him, in what capacity; as family members, friends or servants etc.;
(j) subsequent conduct, i.e., any event which might have extinguished his entitlement to possession or caused shift therein; and
(k) basis of his claim that not to deliver possession but continue in possession.
71. Apart from these pleadings, the Court must insist on documentary proof in support of the pleadings. All those documents would be relevant which come into existence after the transfer of title or possession or the encumbrance as is claimed. While dealing with the civil suits, at the threshold, the Court must carefully and critically examine pleadings and documents.
72. The court will examine the pleadings for specificity as also the supporting material for sufficiency and then pass appropriate orders.
Discovery and production of documents and answers to interrogatories, together with an approach of considering what in ordinary course of human affairs is more likely to have been the probability, will prevent many a false claim or defences from sailing beyond the stage for issues.
84. False claims and defences are really serious problems with real estated 'litigation, predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate. Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settled with them by paying a huge amount. This happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication of cases in our Courts. If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be minimized to a large extent.
97. This Court in Puran singh Vs. The State of Punjab 1975 (4) SCC 518 held that an occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession.
101. Principles of law which emerge in this case are crystallized as under :-
1. No one acquires title to the property if he or she was allowed to stay in the premises gratuitously. Even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property.
2. Care-taker, watchman or servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession. The caretaker or servant has to give possession forthwith on demand.
3. The Courts are not justified in protecting the possession of a caretaker, servant or any person who was allowed to live in the premises for some time either as a friend, relative, caretaker or as servant.
4. The protection of the Court can only be granted or extended to the person who has valid, subsisting rent agreement, lease' agreement or license agreement in his favour.
The caretaker or agent holds property of the principal only on behalf of the principal. He acquires no right or interest whatsoever for himself in such property irrespective of his long stay or possession.
12. She has also relied upon the decision of Supreme Court in case of Wander Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Antox India P. Ltd., reported in 1990 (Supp) Supreme Court Cases 727. Where the court has the discretionary relief - when it should be granted and the factors which needs to be considered at the time of grant of such relief.
12.1 In case of Premji Ratansey Shah & others Vs. Union of India & others, reported in 1994 (5) Supreme Court Cases 547, the'Court held that no injunction can be issued in favour of a trespasser or a person who gained unlawful possession as against the true owner because it is a discretionary and equitable relief.
13. Both the sides sought reliance in case of Rame Gowda (dead) by Lrs. Vs. M. Varadappa Naidu (dead) by Lrs. & Anr., [Supra] which speaks of concept of settled possession of an occupant who cannot be dispossessed without recourse to law. In this decision the court reiterated the test laid down in case of Puran Singh Vs. State of Punjab., reported in (1975) 4 SCC 518. It would be worthwhile to reproduce observations of the Supreme Court made in case of Rame Goowda [Supra], which reads thus -
""8. It is thus clear that so far as the Indian law is concerned the person in peaceful possession is entitled to retain his possession and in order to protect such possession he may even use reasonable force to keep out a trespasser. A rightful owner who has been wrongfully dispossessed of land may retake possession if he can do so peacefully and without the use of unreasonable force. If the trespasser is in settled possession of the property belonging to the rightful owner, the rightful owner shall have to take recourse to law; he cannot take the law in his own hands and evict the trespasser or interfere with his possession. The law will come to the aid of a person in peaceful and settled possession by injuncting even a rightful owner from using force or taking law in his own hands, and also by restoring him in possession even from the rightful owner (of course subject to the law of Limitation), if the latter has dispossessed the prior possessor by use of force. In the absence of proof of better title, possession or prior peaceful settled possession is itself evidence of title. Law presumes the possession to go with the title] unless rebutted. The owner of any property may prevent even by using reasonable force a trespasser from an attempted trespass, when it is in the process of being committed, or is of a filmsy character, or recurring, intermittent, stray or casual in nature or has just been committed, while the rightful owner did not have enough time to have recourse to law. In the last of the cases, the possession of the trespasser, just entered into would not be called as one acquiesced to by the true owner.
9. It is the settled possession or effective possession of a person without title which would entitle him to protect his possession even as against the true owner. The concept of settled possession and the right of the possessor to protect his possession against the owner has come to be settled by a catena of decisions. Illustratively, we may refer to Munshi Ram and Ors. v. Delhi Administration, 1968 (2) SCR 455, Puran Singh and Ors. v. The State of Punjab, 1975 (4) SCC 518 and Ram Rattan and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1977 (1) SCC 188. The authorities need not be multiplied. In Munshi Ram and Ors.'s case (supra), it was held that no one, including the true owner, has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in the due course of law, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. But merely stray or even intermittent acts of trespass do not give such a right against the true owner. The possession which a trespasser is entitled to defend against the right owner must be settled possession, extending over a sufficiently long period of time and acquiesced to by the true owner. A casual act of possession would not have the effect of interrupting the possession of the rightful owner. The rightful owner may re-enter and re-instate himself provided he does not use more force than is necessary. Such entry will be viewed only as resistance to an intrusion upon his possession which has never been lost. A stray act of trespass, or a possession which has not matured into settled possession, can be obstructed or removed by the true owner even by using necessary force. In Puran Singh and Ors.'s case (supra) , the Court clarified that it is difficult to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when the possession of a trespasser can mature into settled possession. The 'settled possession' must be (i) effective, (ii) undisturbed, and (iii) to the knowledge of the owner or without any attempt and concealment by the trespasser. The phrase settled possession does not carry any special charm of magic in it, nor is it a ritualistic formula which can be confined in a strait-jacket. An occupation of the property by a person as an agent or a servant acting at the instance of the owner will not amount to actual physical possession. The Court laid down the following tests which may be adopted as a working rule for determining the attributes of 'settled possession' :
(i) that the trespasser must be in actual physical possession of the property over a sufficiently long period;
(ii) that the possession must be to the knowledge (either express of implied) of the owner or without any attempt at concealment by the trespasser and which contains an element of animus possidendi. The nature of possession of the trespasser would however, be a matter to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case.
(iii) the process of dispossession of the true owner by the trespasser must be complete and final and must be acquiesced to by the true owner; and
(iv) that one of the usual tests to determine the quality of settled possession, in the case of cultivable land, would be whether or not the trespasser, after having taken possession, had grown any crop. If the crop had been grown by the trespasser, then even the true owner has no right to destroy the crop grown by the trespasser and take forcible possession.
10. In the cases of Munshi Ram and Ors. (supra) and Puran Singh and Ors. (supra), the Court has approved the statement of law made in Horam v. Rex, AIR 1949 All 564, wherein a distinction was drawn between the trespasser in the process of acquiring possession and the trespasser who had already accomplished or completed his possession wherein the true owner may be treated to have acquiesced in while the former can be obstructed and turned out by the true owner even by using reasonable force, the latter, may be dispossessed by the true owner only by having recourse to the due process of law for re-acquiring possession over his property.""
14. Thus, crux of this judgment as could be discerned is that the possession of a trespasser could mature into the settled possession which must be effected in disturbing and to the knowledge of the owner. Therefore, the question that would arise is as to whether the person claiming the possession even if is a trespasser is in equilibrium of the property over a sufficiently long period and whether such possession is to the knowledge of the owner and process of dispossession of the true owner by a lesser has been final and equilibrium to by the true owner. Some of spa e other decisions sought to be relied upon by the petitioner are as follows :-
(1) In case of Tulsi Vs. Smt. Paro (dead), reported in 1997 (1) RCR p. 281
(2) In case of R. Venkataswami Naidu v. M/s. South India Viscose Limited, Coimbatore, reported in AIR 1985 Madras 257;
(3) Smt. Rajnibai alia Mannubai v. Smt. Kamla Devi & Ors., reported in AIR 1996 SC 1946;
(4) Sukkha Singh & Anr. vs. Mahal Singh & Anr., reported in AIR 2003 Rajasthan 21;
(5) In case of Prataprai N. Kothari Vs. John Braganza, reported in AIR 1999 Supreme Court, p. 1666.
(6) Mohd. Sharif v. ADJ No. 2 Sikar & Anr., reported in AIR 2004 Rajasthan 58;
(7) Ramji Rai & Anr. v. Jagdish Mallah (Dead) thro. LRs & Anr., reported in AIR 2007 SC 900;
15. By and large, the decisions are in respect of the suit for permanent injunction for protection of possession, based on long possession where the Court held that the title is not an issue. Dismissal of the suit on the ground that the defendant did not prove his title and on determining that possession as held to be improper, the Courts have held that what requires to be considered is prima facie case which cannot be confused with prima facie title.
16. In light of aforementioned background, whether any interference is warranted in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction requires to be determined.
17. It would be necessary to profitably remember the decision of Apex Court rendered in case of Kokkanda B. Poondacha & Ors. Vs. K.D. Ganapathi & Anr., reported in (2011) 2012 SCC 600, wherein the Apex Court was examining the powers of the High Courts interference with the interlocutory orders of the subordinate court and held that the same is required when the trial court acted without jurisdiction or access of jurisdiction and order resulted in failure of justice. In case of State of West Bengal & Ors. Vs. Samar Kumar Sarkar, reported in (2009) 15 SCC 444 also, it is held that
""power of superintendent conferred upon an High Court under Article 227 is not as extensive as power conferred by Article 226 of the constitution""
. Ordinarily, it is open to the High Court exercising its power of superintendents, only to consider whether there is an error of jurisdiction in the decision of court or tribunal subject to is superintendents.
18. As can be considered by a near grants at the order of the trial court as that the lower Appellate Court of Small Cause that both courts have exhaustively considered the factually and legal aspects. The main thrust of reasoning appear to be none availability of any document indicating prima facie any relationship between tenant and that of the owner. From the beginning, The petitioner herein pleaded oral lease and have also further insisted upon protection of their legal possession. The petitioner also went to an extent of urging that the legal possession requires protection and in such circumstances, both the courts found that the remedy of the petitioner lie else where in as much as there is no substantiating document worth the name to uphold such pleadings and therefore, they both denied equitable relief in favour of the petitioner. Keeping in mind the scope of article 227 of the constitution and the catena of decisions with laid down the ratio in the regard, nowhere the petitioner put point out any jurisdictional error or access of jurisdiction warranting interference.
19. Independently examining the case of the petitioner also, the aspect of possession emerges from the record and other side has also not disputed the possession of the petitioner. However, the oral lease has been challenged by respondent herein. In such circumstances, this court also inquired from the petitioner as to whether there was any semblance of the evidence to support the theory of oral lease, no document is forthcoming. The amount of Rs. 5000/= by way of rent is averred to have been paid to the respondent for the number of years there is no document worth the name to support this say. Believing it for the moment that the respondents were wary of issuing any went receives and acknowledge relationship of a tenant, it is for the petitioner to establish payment of such rent by some means. Neither from any document issued by the respondent nor from even the Bank Account, regular payment towards such oral lease is forthcoming. This was one of the principle grounds the small cause courts and its appellate bench in appeal questioned the very maintainability on the ground of jurisdiction. Many of these issues, of course may require trial but at the same time, when the party approaches the court with a request of equitable relief, it is expected to approach the right forum as also establish prima facie case for those forum to accept such a request. For want of any jurisdictional error or illegality in the order impugned causing grave injustice, no interference under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is warranted in the present writ petition.
20. Resultantly, this petition fails and the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.

"The Court in the proceedings held that the sale deed executed by the respondent in favour of the appellant on 30-9-1987 is held to be invalid and inoperative.
?	The first defendant firm applied to the State Government for exemption, under Section 20(1) of the said Act, and sought permission to hold excess vacant land to an extent admeasuring 16,194 sq m.
?	The entire extent of vacant land in excess of ceiling limits admeasuring a total aggregate extent of 19,638 sq m was exempted, by the State Government, under Section 20(1) of the said Act.
?	The first defendant firm obtained permission from the State Government under Orders dated 6-3-1987 and 18-4-1987 to sell to the plaintiffs the excess vacant land admeasuring 19,638 sq m, as set out in Paras 3 and 4 hereinafter.
?	The High Court has set aside the order of the trial court which allowed the amendment under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC. Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the appellant has preferred this appeal.
?	The appellant submitted that the Court should be liberal in allowing amendments and the respondents be compensated by costs.
?	It was submitted that the appellant cannot seek any amendment of the plaint relying on the circumstances as to the earlier decision having been overruled by seeking amendment of the plaint.
?	21. The respondents relied on the decision of this Court in Usha Balashaheb Swami v. Kiran Appaso Swami 2007 5 SCC 602 wherein the Court has held that by way of amendment, admission made in pleadings and particularly in the plaint cannot be sought to be omitted or got rid of.
?	The Court further observed that a prayer for amendment of the plaint stands on a different footing.
?	Addition of a new ground of defence or substituting or altering a defence or taking inconsistent pleas in the written statement would not be objectionable while adding, altering or substituting a new cause of action in the plaint may be objectionable.
?	The High Court in revision affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that by means of amendment the defendant wanted to introduce an entirely different case and if such amendments were permitted it would prejudice the other side.
?	The High Court rightly rejected the application for amendment and agreed with the trial court.""
?	26. In the same judgment of Usha Balashaheb Swami, the Court dealt with a number of judgments of this Court and laid down that the prayer for amendment of the plaint and a prayer for amendment of the written statement stand on different footings.
?	All rules of court are nothing but provisions intended to secure the proper administration of justice, and it is essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose, so that full powers of amendment must be enjoyed and should always be liberally exercised, but no power has been given to enable one distinct cause of action to be substituted for another, nor to change, by means of amendment, the subject-matter of the suit.""
?	All civil courts ordinarily have a long list of cases the courts are compelled to grant long dates which causes delay in disposal of the cases.
?	For allowing amendment, it is not just costs, but the delays caused thereby, benefit of such delays and the additional costs which had to be incurred by the victim of the amendment.
?	The High Court upheld the order and dismissed the appeal.
?	Though the Court noticed ""considerable force"" in the objection, keeping in view the prayer in the amendment which was not ""foreign to the scope of the suit"" and all necessary facts were on record, it allowed the amendment.
?	A then filed a substantive suit against B and C. In the plaint, except saying that he had obtained a decree against B, nothing more was stated by A. he filed an application for amendment which was rejected by the trial court but allowed by the High Court.
?	Dismissing the appeal and confirming the order of the High Court, this Court observed that the discretionary power of amendment was not exercised by the High Court on wrong principles.
?	When the matter reached this Court, while affirming the order of the High Court, the majority stated: (AIR p. 18, para 14)
?	The decisions holding that amendments could not ordinarily be allowed beyond the period of limitation and the limited exceptions to that rule have no application.
?	Reversing the order of the High Court, this Court (per Shah, J., as he then was) made the following oft-quoted observations: (SCC p. 871, para 5)
?	Setting aside the order of the High Court, this Court stated: (SCC p. 399, para 22)
?	The power to allow the amendment is wide and can be exercised at any stage of the proceedings in the interests of justice on the basis of guidelines laid down by various High Courts and [the Supreme Court].
?	The courts have very wide discretion in the matter of amendment of pleadings but court's powers must be exercised judiciously and with great care.
?	The imposition of costs is an important judicial exercise particularly when the courts deal with the cases of amendment.
?	(iii) The financial benefit derived by one party at the cost of other party should be properly calculated in terms of money and the costs be awarded .
?	We can conclude our discussion by observing that while deciding applications for amendments the courts must not refuse bona fide, legitimate, honest and necessary amendments and should never permit mala fide, worthless and/or dishonest amendments.
?	The appeal being devoid of any merit is dismissed with costs.

"Dr. Arijit Pasayat, J.? Leave granted.
2. Challenge in this appeal is to the legality of judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court allowing the transfer petition filed by the respondent in terms of Section 24 of the Code of CivilProcedure, 1908 (in short ?CPC?). By the transfer petition the respondent had sought for transfer of IDOP No. 46 of 2003 pending in the Court of District Judge, Kanyakumari at Nagercoil to the Court of Family Judge, Chennai. The High Court accepted the prayer.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that between the parties there was an earlier proceeding which came before this Court in Y. Abraham Ajith v. Inspector of Police 2004 8 SCC 100. It is submitted that in view of what has been stated in the said case the impugned order cannot be maintained. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the order of the High Court.
4. In Y. Abraham Ajith case it was, inter alia, observed as follows: (SCC pp. 104-06, paras 9-18)
?9. ?All crime is local, the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed?, as observed by Blackstone. A significant word used in Section 177 of the Code [of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ?the Code?)] is ?ordinarily?. Use of the word indicates that the provision is a general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Code. As observed by the Court inPurushottamdas Dalmia v. State Of West Bengal. AIR 1961 SC 1589, L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras. AIR 1961 SC 1601, Banwarilal Jhunjhunwala v. Union of India AIR 1963 SC 1620 and Mohan Baitha v. State of Bihar 2001 4 SCC 350 exception implied by the word ?ordinarily? need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on consideration or may be implied from the provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same court. No such exception is applicable to the case at hand.
10. As observed by this Court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi AIR 1973 SC 908 a continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all, that it is one of those offences which arises out of the failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, liability continues till compliance, that on every occasion such disobedience or non-compliance occurs or recurs, there is the offence committed.
11. A similar plea relating to continuance of the offence was examined by this Court in Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee 1997 5 SCC 30. There the allegations related to commission of alleged offences punishable under sections 498-a, 506 and 323 ipc. On the factual background, it was noted that though the dowry demands were made earlier, the husband of the complainant went to the place where the complainant was residing and had assaulted her. This Court held in that factual background that Clause (c) of Section 178 was attracted. But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband on 15-4-1997 on account of alleged dowry demands by the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai. That being so, the logic of Section 178(c) of the Code relating to continuance of the offences cannot be applied.
12. The crucial question is whether any part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court concerned. In terms of section 177 of the code, it is the place where the offence was committed. In essence it is the cause of action for initiation of the proceedings against the accused.
13. While in civil cases, normally the expression ?cause of action? is used, in criminal cases as stated in section 177 of the code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed. These variations in etymological expression do not really make the position different. The expression ?cause of action? is, therefore, not a stranger to criminal cases.
14. It is settled law that cause of action consists of a bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law applicable to them, gives the allegedly affected party a right to claim relief against the opponent. It must include some act done by the latter since in the absence of such an act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would arise.
15. The expression ?cause of action? has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense cause of action means the circumstances forming the infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for the action. In the wider sense, it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the proceeding including not only the alleged infraction, but also the infraction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously, the expression means every fact, which it would be necessary for the complainant to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right or grievance to the judgment of the court. Every fact, which is necessary to be proved, as distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is necessary to prove such fact, comprises in ?cause of action?.
16. The expression ?cause of action? has sometimes been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which constitute either the infringement or the basis of a right and no more. In a wider and more comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote the whole bundle of material facts.
17. The expression ?cause of action? is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for sitting; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. In Black's Law Dictionary a ?cause of action? is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which, if traversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In Words and Phrases (4th Edn.), the meaning attributed to the phrase ?cause of action? in common legal parlance is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf.
18. In Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn.) it has been stated as follows:
? ?Cause of action? has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation, the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. ?Cause of action? has also been taken to mean that a particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject-matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action.? ?
5. No doubt the decision was rendered in the background of the Code, it has relevance so far as the present dispute is concerned.
6. In view of what has been stated in the aforesaid case, it would be appropriate for the High Court to reconsider the matter. The appeal is accordingly disposed of without any order as to costs.

"Vinod K. Sharma, J. (Oral) ? This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been moved for quashing of FIR No. 163 dated 21.10.2005 registered at Police Station Garshankar District Hoshiarpur under Sections 406, 498-A IPC and subsequent proceedings arising therefrom.
2. The FIR against the petitioners reads as under :?
Sir, it is submitted that I Harjinder Kaur d/o Dilbag Singh r/o 47 Fendor Way, Brompton, Ontario, Canada. I was married on 04.09.99 to the accused Kirpal Singh s/o Satwant Singh r/o House No. 819 Sector 38, Chandigarh also known as Dadu Majra Colony before marriage. Kirpal Singh was residing at Canada and was driving a truck at Canada. The marriage was an arranged marriage and was performed with Sikh religious rites and ceremony at Preet Palace, Rahon Road, Nawanshahr. At the time of marriage the accused Kirpal Singh was given one golden kara, one gold ring, one woollen suit and cash Rs. 11000/-. Accused Satwant Singh was given one golden ring, one woollen suit and cash Rs. 5100/-. Accused Joginder Kaur was given gold set, two gold bangles, one ring and cash Rs. 5100/-. Besides this my parents also gave other house hold articles for my use, one Fridge, cooler, washing machines and utensils on the demand raised the accused cash Rs. One lac was also given to the accused persons. Besides this my parents also gave gold jewellery worth Rs. 50,000/- to daughter Harjinder Kaur at the time of the marriage. Out of the said wedlock a son namely Simerdeep Singh was born to me and Kirpal Singh. As Kirpal Singh was residing at Canada before marriage, so I was also called at Canada to settle there. On 21.12.2002 my sister Sukhwinder died in a road accident and after the death of my sister my in-laws started pressurizing me to get the land and other belongings of my parents transferred in the name of my husband Kirpal Singh otherwise they would not keep me. Accused Kirpal Singh also started giving severe beating to me in order to pressurize me to get land and other belonging transferred in his name. I narrated my tale of woes to my parents and told them that I was being maltreated and harassed by Kirpal Singh who is being insulted by me in-laws to all these acts. I visited India in the month of March, 2003 on the account of my sister's death. At that time I went to my in-laws who pressurized me to keep the minor children with them for a few months. Under these circumstances, I despite resistance left tile child in India and thereafter I went back to Canada. After going back to Canada my husband started pressurizing me to get all the belongings and land transferred to his name and otherwise he would not let me live with him. I requested that my parents are of limited means and have already given sufficient dowry at the time of marriage and did not have any other means to pay anything except a small piece of land. But my husband started harassing and maltreating me there after the marriage. I was not being treated in a proper manner but the problem became very serious are my return from India. My husband started maltreating me mentally, physically and emotionally. Under these circumstances I took up a job in Canada on the condition that I would hand over entire salary to my husband. It would be important to mention here that I was maintaining a joint account with my husband and the entire amount given by me in cash and other amounts as earned by me was also kept. In the month of November, 2003 a fight took place between me and any husband and he left nothing after taking away all my jewellery and other belongings. The said jewellery was??..dollars. It also came to my notice later on that my husband took all the house hold articles, gold ornaments, belongings and not only this he in fact had withdrawn all the money from the joint account which was around 50000 dollars. My husband had withdrawn money from the joint account without informing me on account 7 2003, 9000 dollars and October 25, 2003, 4634, 57 dollars in this way. I was completely left penniless and was frauded at the hands of my husband who left me. He is illegally occupying all the dowry articles and other belongings of me that? this mental trauma in order to save my marriage and requested my parents to initiate a dialogue with my in-laws who were settled at Chandigarh. That in the month of August 2004, I came to India along with my husband to bring Simerdeep (my son) back to Canada. My in-laws refused to keep me and also refused to hand over the custody of the minor child. My parents visited to my in-laws and tried to convince them to settle with me but my in laws who were greedy sort of persons threw me out of the house and stated that they did not have any concern with our family and that there is no place for me in the house. They misappropriated the dowry and other cash amount which fraudulently taken by my husband and mis-appropriated all the dowry articles given by my parents at the time of marriage to me which were part of Istri Dhan and were for my exclusive use. They threw me from my matrimonial home by giving severe beating. The accused persons also stated that they have got high up links and would implicate me in some false case in case she reported the matter in police. That after my return to India I stayed at village Denowal Kalan and on went away to Canada. I went to Canada. The accused persons in connivance with one Malwinder Singh son of Kashmir Singh resident of Dhanas moved a false and frivolous complaint writing allegations about cheating made by me. It has been alleged in the said complaint that I had taken away a sum of Rs. 5 lacs from this person on account of taking him abroad in cash. The story as given by this person is due to the fact that he had joined hands with my in-laws and at their behest a false and frivolous story was created to implicate me. My husband got a photostat copy of my ticket of journey to India with him and later on in connivance with his parents manufactured a receipt in the name of Mohinder Singh said Mohinder Singh also joined hands in the illegal act of forging receipts and was in conspiracy with accused namely Kirpal Singh, Satwant Singh and his wife. That on account of said false and frivolous complaints my parents were being unnecessary harassed by police station Sector 17, Economic Offence Wing and they are threatening to implicate my parents that all the accused persons have indulged in illegal acts firstly treating me with severe cruelty. My husband had committed many excesses with me and I was often given beatings on many occasions. My husband tried to kill me. However, I was saved with the grace of the God. All my cash ornaments, jewellery, household articles were illegally taken by them and used by these accused persons. Now only this, these accused persons hatched a conspiracy to involve in a false case. These accused persons prepared a forged receipt in the name of Mohinder Singh who was also a part of the conspiracy. The said accused Mohinder Singh acting as per conspiracy tried to involve me in a false case by lodging complaint with Economic Offence Wing that he was duped of Rs. 5 lacs by me on the pretext of taking him abroad. In said complaint even my parents were mentally harassed. All these accused person have made mockery of the process of law by initiating false and frivolous complaint and by preparing a false receipt in my name of have made themselves liable for offence of forging and cheating. The entire exercise of the accused was so that I may not take any action for claiming custody of the child and to claim my dowry articles. All the accused namely Kirpal Singh, Satwant Singh, and his wife Joginder Kaur and Mohinder Singh have committed an illegal act and that case be registered against them for committing offence under Sections 406, 498-A, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC and justice be done to me. Applicant???.Harjinder Kaur 42, Brompton, Ontario, Canada.?
3. The reading of the FIR would show that no offence is alleged to have taken place within the jurisdiction of Hoshiarpur or at Garshankar. The complainant is also not residing within the jurisdiction of said police station so as to invoke the provision of Section 181 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to prosecute the accused at the place of residence of the complainant. Harjinder Kaur complainant is admittedly residing in Canada since the year 2000. Kirpal Singh is also citizen of Canada and a petition for divorce and custody of the child has been filed in a Family Court at Ontario, Canada. Instead of returning the complaint to the complainant the police authority took upon itself to investigate the case without there being any jurisdiction with them in view of the allegation levelled in the FIR. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. v. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr., 2004 (3) RCR (Criminal) 988 : 2004 (3) Apex Criminal 455 : AIR 2004 SC 4286 has been pleased to lay down as under :?
?Sections 177 to 186 deal with venue and place of trial. Section 177 reiterates the well-established common law rule referred to in Halsbury's Laws of England (Vol. IX para 83) that the proper and ordinary venue for the trial of a crime is the area of jurisdiction in which, on the evidence, the facts occur and which alleged to constitute the crime. There are several exceptions to this general rule and some of them are, so far as the present case is concerned indicated in Section 178 of the Code which read as follows :
?Section 178 PLACE OF INQUIRY OR TRIAL :
(a) When it is uncertain in which of several local areas an offence was committed, or (b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another, or (c) where an offence is continuing one and continues to be committed in more local areas than one, or (d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas, it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.?
?All crime is local, the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed?, as observed by Blackstone. A significant word used in Section 177 of the Code is ?ordinarily?. Use of the word indicates the provision is a general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Code. As observed by the Court in Purushottamdas Dalmia v. State Of West Bengal. (AIR 1961 SC 1589), L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras. (AIR 1961 SC 1601), Banwarilal Jhunhunwalla and Ors. v. Union of India and Anr. (AIR 1963 SC 1620) and Mohan Baitha and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Anr., 2001 (2) RCR (Criminal) 381 : 2001 (4) SCC 370, exception implied by the word ?ordinarily? need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on consideration or may be implied from the provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same Court. No such exception is applicable to the case at hand.
As observed by this Court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran, Nenshi and Anr. (AIR 1973 SC 908) continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance, and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all, that it is one of those offences which arises out of the failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, liability continues till compliance, that on every occasion such disobedience or non-compliance occurs or recurs there is the offence committed.
A similar plea relating to continuance of the offence was examined by this Court in Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee, 1997 (3) RCR (Criminal) 198 : (1997 (5) SCC 30). There the allegations related to commission of alleged offence punishable under Sections 498A, 506 and 323 IPC. On the factual background, it was noted that though the dowry demands were made earlier the husband of the complainant went to the place where complainant was residing and had assaulted her. This Court held in that factual background that clause (c) of Section 178 was attracted. But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband on 15.4.1997 on account of alleged dowry demands by the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai. That being so, the logic of Section 178 (c) of the Code relating to continuance of the offences cannot be applied.
The crucial question is whether any part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the concerned Court. In terms of Section 177 of the Code it is the place where the offence was committed. In essence it is the cause of action for initiation of the proceedings against the accused.
Where in civil cases, normally the expression ?cause of action? is issued, in criminal cases as stated in Section 177 of the Code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed. The expression ?cause of action? is therefore not a stranger to criminal cases. It is settled law that cause of action consists of bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law applicable to them gives the allegedly affected partly a right to claim relief against the opponent. It must include some act done by the latter since in the absence of such an act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would arise.
The expression ?cause of action? has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense cause of action means the circumstance forming the infraction of the right of the immediate occasion for the action. In the wider sence, it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the proceeding including not only the alleged infraction, but also the infarction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously the expression means every fact, which it would be necessary for the complainant to prove, it traversed, in order to support his right or grievance to the judgment of the Court. Every fact, which is necessary to be proved as distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is necessary to prove such fact, comprises in ?cause of action.?
The expression ?cause of action? has sometimes been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which constitute either the infringement or the basis of a right and no more. In a wider and more comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote the whole bundle of material facts.
The expression ?cause of action? is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for sitting; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. (Black's Law Dictionary a ?cause of action? is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which, if traversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In ?Words and Pharases? (4th Edn.) the meaning attributed to the pharase ?cause of action? in common legal parlance is existence of those facts which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf.
In Halsbury Laws of England (Fourth Edition) it has been stated as follows :
?Cause of action? has been defined as meaning simple a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed and even fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. ?Cause of action? has also been taken to mean that particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action?.
When the aforesaid legal principles are applied, to the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint petition, the inevitable conclusion is that no part of cause of action arose in Chennai and, therefore, the concerned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter.?
4. The proceedings initiated on the complaint of the complainant herein clearly shows that the complainant has used her influence with the authority and succeeded in harassing the petitioners for number of years. This is a classic case of misuse of process of the Court where process of the law has been used as a tool to harass the petitioners to vindicate her grudge on account of the proceedings taken out at Canada. In view of the fact that two the Courts at Garshankar/Hoshiarpur have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the case and also that this is a case of misuse of process of the Court and the proceedings have been initiated with mala fide intention; the FIR No. 163 dated 21.10.2005 registered at Police Station Garshankar District Hoshiarpur under Sections 406, 498-A IPC and subsequent proceedings arising therefrom are ordered to be quashed.
5. Petition allowed.
In view of the harassment caused to the petitioners, they are held entitled to cost of this petition, which is assessed at Rs. 10,000/-.
Petition allowed.

"Vinod K. Sharma, J.:? This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been moved for quashing the complaint filed under Sections 420/406/34 of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as well as the summoning order dated 27-03-2006, attached as Annexure P-2 to this petition.
2. The complainant-respondent Bank filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (for short ?the Act?) against the petitioner on the allegation that cheques issued by the petitioner against the payment of outstanding amount were dishonoured for want of sufficient funds.
3. On cheques being dishonoured, a legal notice was issued, but as the payment was not made within 7 days as directed, the complaint was filed. The offence under Sections 420 and 406 read with Section 34 IPC was not made out on the allegations leveled in the complaint. However, vide order dated 27-03-2006 passed by the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Bathinda, the petitioner was summoned under Section 138 of the Act, as he failed to make the payment in spite of receipt of notice.
4. The petitioner seeks the quashing of the complaint on the ground that the Courts at Bathinda, had no jurisdiction to entertain and try the present complaint.
5. It is the case of the petitioner that he is permanent resident of Moga and he has approached the ICICI Bank at Moga for grant of personal loan which was sanctioned. The petitioner gave 12 cheques of Rs. 4,581/- each drawn on Dena Bank, Branch Moga. These cheques were said to have been given as a security.
6. The reading of the complaint transpires that the cheques given by the petitioners were dishonoured at Moga, i.e Bank Branch, where the cheques were given by the complainant.
7. Learned counsel for the respondent-Bank opposes this plea that offence under Section 138 of the Act can be completed only with the concatenation of number of acts i.e (1) Drawing of the cheque, (2) Presentation of the cheque to the Bank, (3) Returning the cheque unpaid by the drawee Bank, (4) Giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque unpaid by the drawee Bank, (4) Giving notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque demanding payment of the cheque amount and (5) Failure of the drawer to make payment within 15 days of the receipt of notice.
8. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank by placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan,1 is that all the above five acts should have been perpetrated at the same locality. It is possible that each of those five acts is a sine qua non for completion of an offence under Section 138 of the Act. A reliance in this regard was also placed on Section 178(d) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads as under:?
Where the offence consists of several acts done in different local areas, it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.?
9. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent-Bank is that as the notice was issued from Bathinda, therefore the Court at Bathinda would have the jurisdiction to try the present case.
10. Learned counsel for the respondent also placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of A.K Desai v. State of Punjab,2 wherein this Court has been pleased to lay down that ?when a notice after dishonour of cheque is issued from Hoshiarpur, then the Court at Hoshiarpur, from where the cheque was issued, would have the jurisdiction to try the offence.?
11. Learned counsel for the respondent-Bank also placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of D. Vinod Shivappa v. Nanda Belliappa,3 to contend that failure on the part of a drawer to pay the amount should be within 15 days of the receipt of the said notice. It was clear that giving of notice in the context was not the same as receipt of notice. Giving was the process of which the receipt was the accomplishment and, therefore, it was held that time has to commence from the date of receipt and not date of issuance.
12. However, on a consideration of matter, I find force in the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
13. In view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of D. Vinod Shivappa (supra), it is the receipt which will have to be taken into consideration and not issuance of the notice. If this principle is applied to the facts of the present case, it would be seen that even the notice issued by the complaint-Bank was in fact received at Moga. Thus in the present case, all the acts, which are components of offence under Section 138 of the Act have taken place at Moga and, therefore, the Court at Bathinda would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the present complaint.
14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Y. Abraham Ajith v. Inspector of Police, Chennai,4 has dealt with the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain and try the offence, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been pleased to lay down as under:?
?Section 177 to 186 deal with venue and place of trial. Section 177 reiterates the well-established common law rule referred to in Halsbury's Laws of England (VOUX para 83) that the proper and ordinary venue for the trial of a crime is the area of jurisdiction in which, on the evidence, the facts occur and which alleged to constitute the crime. There are several exceptions to this general rule and some of them are, so far as the present case is concerned, indicated in Section 178 of the Code which read follows:
Section 178 Place of Inquiry or Trial.
(a) When it is uncertain in which of several local areas an offence was committed, or (b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another, or (c) where an offence is continuing one, and continues to be committed in more local areas than one, or (d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas, it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.?
?All crime is local, the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed?, as observed by Blackstone. A significant word used in Section 177 of the Code is ?ordinarily?. Use of the word indicates that the provision is a general one and must be read subject 0 the special provisions contained in the Code. As observed by the Court in Purushottamdas Dalmia v. State Of West Bengal., (AIR 1961 SC 1589), L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras.. (AIR 1961 SC 1601), Banwarilal Jhunhunwalla v. Union of India, (AIR 1963 SC 1620) and Mohan Baitha v. State of Bihar, (2001) 4 SCC 350 : AIR 2001 SC 1400 : (2001 (4) S.C.C 350, exception implied by the word ?ordinarily? need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on consideration or may be implied from the provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same Court. No such exception is applicable to the case at hand.
As observed by this Court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi, ((1972) 2 SCC 890 : AIR 1974 SC 908) continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all, that it is one of those offences which arises out of the failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, liability continues till compliance, that on every occasion such disobedience or non-compliance occurs or recurs, there is the offence committed.
A similar plea relating to continuance of the offence was examined by this Court in Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee, (1997 (5) S.C.C 30). There the allegations related to commission of alleged offence punishable under Section 498A, 506 and 323 IPC. On the factual background, it was noted that though the dowry demands were made earlier the husband of the complainant went to the place where complainant was residing and had assaulted her. This Court held in that factual background that clause (c) of Section 178 was attracted. But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband on 15.4.1997 on account of alleged dowry demands by the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai.

The proceedings are quashed. The complaint be returned to respondent No. 2 who, if she so chooses, may file the same in the appropriate Court to be dealt with in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly allowed.?
20. In view of the authoritative pronouncements, the Court at Bathinda would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the present case.
21. Consequently, this petition is allowed. The complaint and subsequent proceedings are ordered to be quashed.
22. The learned trial Court is directed to return the complaint to the respondent-Bank, who may, if it so advised, choose to file the same in the appropriate Court in accordance with law.

"The respondents moved an application under Section 340 CrPC requesting the court to file a criminal complaint against Appellant 1 as the Will set up by him was forged.
?	The complaint was dismissed by the order dated 2-5-1998.
?	The revision petition was allowed and the matter was remanded to the Court of Metropolitan
?	The appellants challenged the order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge by filing a petition under Section 482 CrPC before the Delhi High Court, but the same was dismissed on 15-9-2000 following the law laid down in Sachida Nand Singh.
?	One possible interpretation is that when an offence described in Section 463 or punishable under Section 471, Section 475 or Section 476 IPC is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document which is subsequently produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court, a complaint by the court would be necessary.
?	On the interpretation if the offence as described in the section is committed prior to production or giving in evidence of the document in court, no complaint by court would be necessary and a private complaint would be maintainable.
?	Any offence committed with respect to a document at a time prior to its production or giving in evidence in court cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be an offence affecting the administration of justice.
?	As the purity of the proceedings of the court is directly sullied by the crime, the court is considered to be the only party entitled to consider the desirability of complaining against the guilty party.
?	(ii) The offences about which the court alone is clothed with the right to complain may be appropriately considered to be only those offences committed by a party to a proceeding in that court, the commission of which has a reasonably close nexus with the proceeding in that court so that it can without embarking upon a completely independent and fresh inquiry, satisfactorily consider by reference principally to its records the expediency of prosecuting the delinquent party.
?	It appears to be more appropriate to adopt the strict construction of confirming the prohibition contained in Section 195(1)(c) only to those cases in which the offences specified therein were committed by a party to the proceeding in character as such party.
?	The appellants moved the High Court for quashing of the proceedings on the ground that in absence of a complaint by the court, the prosecution was barred under Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC.
?	Section 467 IPC as well and the Magistrate was competent to take cognizance on the complaint.
?	The Court reversed the view taken by the High Court observing that as Section 463 defines the offence of forgery and Section 467 punishes forgery of a particular category, Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC would be attracted and in the absence of a complaint by the court the prosecution would not be maintainable.
?	If the provisions of clause (c) are extended to witnesses, the extension would be in conformity with the broad principle which forms the basis of Section 195.""
?	Before filing of the complaint, the court may hold a preliminary enquiry and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests of justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to in Section 195(1)(b).
?	Section 343(2) confers a discretion upon a court trying the complaint to adjourn the hearing of the case if it is brought to its notice that an appeal is pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial proceeding out of which the matter has arisen.
?	In order that a victim of a crime of forgery, namely, the person aggrieved is able to exercise his right conferred by law to initiate prosecution of the offender, it is necessary to place a restrictive interpretation on clause (b)(ii).
?	The provision only creates a bar against taking cognizance of an offence in certain specified situations except upon complaint by court.
?	The principle that a penal statute should be strictly construed, as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants can have no application .
?	Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC would be attracted only when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been committed with respect to a document after it has been produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court i.e during the time when the document was in custodia legis.
?	The bar created by Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC would not come into play and there is no embargo on the power of the court to take cognizance of the offence on the basis of the complaint filed by the respondents.
?	35. The appeal is dismissed.
?	37. The High Court in the impugned order dismissed the petition filed by the appellant under Section 482 CrPC relying upon the decision of this Court in Sachida Nand Singh.

"On request of the counsel for the parties, these four Misc. Civil Cases are heard as connected matters and are being disposed of by this common order.
2. Factual matrix lies in a narrow compass.
(a) Misc. Civil Cases Nos. 31 & 33 of 1993 :
The applicant (CIT, Bhopal) has filed applications under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, 1961 (for short the Act)seeking direction to the Tribunal to state the cases and refer the undernoted common question, labelled as of law, arising out of the order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 passed by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 339/Ind/90 and 400/Ind/90 after rejection of the applications, presented under s. 256(1) of the Act, registered as RA Nos. 103/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1984-85 and 105/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1985-86. The assessee was granted registration for the asst. yr. 1982-83 on 4th March, 1983 under s. 185 of the Act. For the asst. yr. 1983-84, the firm was granted registration again under s. 185 by the AO on 10th Jan., 1984. On 23rd Aug., 1984, action was initiated under s. 132 of the Act. Certain papers showed secret profits made by the assessee. Such secret profits were not found to have been distributed amongst the partners in these two years. The assessee had admitted that secret profits were earned. The AO, therefore, issued a show-cause notice on 4th Aug., 1986 calling upon the assessee to show cause as to why registration granted for the two years be not cancelled as provided under s. 186 of the Act as the condition for distribution of profits was violated. The assessees explanation was not found satisfactory. The AO, therefore, cancelled the registration under s. 186 of the Act. On appeal, CIT(A) set aside the order of the AO with a direction to AO to make fresh order. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the Revenue. The Revenue then filed the applications under s. 256(1) of the Act. The applications were dismissed. These applications are, thus, filed under s. 256(2) of the Act. The undernoted common question is proposed in these two applications :
""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in setting aside the orders of the AO under s. 185(1)(b) of the IT Act ?""
(b) Misc. Civil Cases Nos. 32 & 34 of 1993 :
The applicant (CIT, Bhopal) has filed applications under s. 256(2) of the Act seeking direction to the Tribunal to state the cases and refer the undernoted common question, labelled as of law, arising out of the order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 passed by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 208/Ind/90 and 211/Ind/90 after rejection of the applications, presented under s. 256(1) of the Act, registered as RA Nos. 102/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1982-83 and 103/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1983-84 on 10th Aug., 1992. In these cases the additional facts are that against the order passed by the CIT(A), the Department as well as the assessee filed appeals before the Tribunal. The Tribunal set aside the order of the CIT(A) and cancelled the order of the AO under s. 186 holding that the genuiness of the firm for which registration was granted earlier was not doubted by the AO and that the discovery of secret income would not constitute the ground for cancellation of the registration under s. 186. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the applicant filed applications under s. 256(1) of the Act. The applications were rejected. The applicant then filed these applications under s. 256(2) of the Act. In these two Misc. Civil Cases, the under noted common question is proposed :
""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in cancelling the order under s. 186 of the Act particularly when the secret profits have not been distributed amongst the partners according to the profit sharing ratio ?""
3. We have heard Shri Vivek Sharan, learned counsel for the applicant/Revenue and Shri S. K. Jain, learned counsel for the non-applicant/assessee in all the aforesaid Misc. Civil Cases.
4. The Tribunal on applications declined to state the cases and refer the questions as under :
""The Tribunal on appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the case on record reached the conclusion that the genuineness of the firm was not at all questioned and, therefore, the registration should not have been cancelled. This is obviously a finding of fact and no referable question of law arises.
The AO did not permit continuation of registration of the firm for the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86. On appeal, the CIT(A) held that the appeal did not lie for the asst. yr. 1985-86. So far as the asst. yr. 1984-85 is concerned, he set aside the order for fresh decision.
On appeal the Tribunal held that the appeal did lie before the CIT(A). The Tribunal, therefore, set aside the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1985-86. The Tribunal sustained the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1984-85. It directed the AO to consider the applications of the assessee for the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86 afresh in the light of its order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 in ITA Nos. 208 to 211/Ind/90. From these facts it is obvious that no referable question of law arises from the order of the Tribunal relating to the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86.""
The case relating to asst. yr. 1982-83 & 1983-84 was also not found fit for reference.
5. In CIT vs. Khanna Theatre (1990) 184 ITR 156 (MP) it is held by this Court that as per provisions of IT Rules, 1962, prior distribution of profits or losses among the partners is not compulsory. The question presented in the aforesaid case was answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
6. In view of the legal position and the order of the Tribunal, as extracted above, we are satisfied that these cases do not involve referable questions of law. The direction is based on appreciation of facts and features. In CIT vs. Ashoka Marketing Ltd. (1976) 103 ITR 543 (SC) and in CIT vs. Kotrika Venkataswamy & Sons(1971) 79 ITR 499 (SC), it is held that the conclusion based on appreciation of facts does not give rise to any question of law.
7. In view of the aforesaid position, we reject these applications but with no orders as to costs.
8. Counsel fee for each side is, however, fixed at Rs. 750, if certified.
9. Retain this order in the record of Misc. Civil Case No. 31 of 1993 and place its copy each in the records of the connected Misc. Civil Cases, as particularised above, for ready reference.

On request of the counsel for the parties, these four Misc. Civil Cases are heard as connected matters and are being disposed of by this common order.
2. Factual matrix lies in a narrow compass.
(a) Misc. Civil Cases Nos. 31 & 33 of 1993 :
The applicant (CIT, Bhopal) has filed applications under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, 1961 (for short the Act)seeking direction to the Tribunal to state the cases and refer the undernoted common question, labelled as of law, arising out of the order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 passed by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 339/Ind/90 and 400/Ind/90 after rejection of the applications, presented under s. 256(1) of the Act, registered as RA Nos. 103/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1984-85 and 105/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1985-86. The assessee was granted registration for the asst. yr. 1982-83 on 4th March, 1983 under s. 185 of the Act.

The AO, therefore, issued a show-cause notice on 4th Aug., 1986 calling upon the assessee to show cause as to why registration granted for the two years be not cancelled as provided under s. 186 of the Act as the condition for distribution of profits was violated. The assessees explanation was not found satisfactory. The AO, therefore, cancelled the registration under s. 186 of the Act. On appeal, CIT(A) set aside the order of the AO with a direction to AO to make fresh order. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the Revenue. The Revenue then filed the applications under s. 256(1) of the Act. The applications were dismissed. These applications are, thus, filed under s. 256(2) of the Act. The undernoted common question is proposed in these two applications :
""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in setting aside the orders of the AO under s. 185(1)(b) of the IT Act ?""
(b) Misc. Civil Cases Nos. 32 & 34 of 1993 :
The applicant (CIT, Bhopal) has filed applications under s. 256(2) of the Act seeking direction to the Tribunal to state the cases and refer the undernoted common question, labelled as of law, arising out of the order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 passed by the Tribunal in ITA Nos. 208/Ind/90 and 211/Ind/90 after rejection of the applications, presented under s. 256(1) of the Act, registered as RA Nos. 102/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1982-83 and 103/Ind/1992 for asst. yr. 1983-84 on 10th Aug., 1992. In these cases the additional facts are that against the order passed by the CIT(A), the Department as well as the assessee filed appeals before the Tribunal. The Tribunal set aside the order of the CIT(A) and cancelled the order of the AO under s. 186 holding that the genuiness of the firm for which registration was granted earlier was not doubted by the AO and that the discovery of secret income would not constitute the ground for cancellation of the registration under s. 186. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the applicant filed applications under s. 256(1) of the Act. The applications were rejected. The applicant then filed these applications under s. 256(2) of the Act. In these two Misc. Civil Cases, the under noted common question is proposed :
""Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in cancelling the order under s. 186 of the Act particularly when the secret profits have not been distributed amongst the partners according to the profit sharing ratio ?""
3. We have heard Shri Vivek Sharan, learned counsel for the applicant/Revenue and Shri S. K. Jain, learned counsel for the non-applicant/assessee in all the aforesaid Misc. Civil Cases.
4. The Tribunal on applications declined to state the cases and refer the questions as under :
""The Tribunal on appreciation of the facts and circumstances of the case on record reached the conclusion that the genuineness of the firm was not at all questioned and, therefore, the registration should not have been cancelled. This is obviously a finding of fact and no referable question of law arises.
The AO did not permit continuation of registration of the firm for the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86. On appeal, the CIT(A) held that the appeal did not lie for the asst. yr. 1985-86. So far as the asst. yr. 1984-85 is concerned, he set aside the order for fresh decision.
On appeal the Tribunal held that the appeal did lie before the CIT(A). The Tribunal, therefore, set aside the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1985-86. The Tribunal sustained the order of the CIT(A) for the asst. yr. 1984-85. It directed the AO to consider the applications of the assessee for the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86 afresh in the light of its order dt. 31st Jan., 1992 in ITA Nos. 208 to 211/Ind/90. From these facts it is obvious that no referable question of law arises from the order of the Tribunal relating to the asst. yrs. 1984-85 and 1985-86.""
The case relating to asst. yr. 1982-83 & 1983-84 was also not found fit for reference.
5. In CIT vs. Khanna Theatre (1990) 184 ITR 156 (MP) it is held by this Court that as per provisions of IT Rules, 1962, prior distribution of profits or losses among the partners is not compulsory. The question presented in the aforesaid case was answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
6. In view of the legal position and the order of the Tribunal, as extracted above, we are satisfied that these cases do not involve referable questions of law. The direction is based on appreciation of facts and features. In CIT vs. Ashoka Marketing Ltd. (1976) 103 ITR 543 (SC) and in CIT vs. Kotrika Venkataswamy & Sons(1971) 79 ITR 499 (SC), it is held that the conclusion based on appreciation of facts does not give rise to any question of law.
7. In view of the aforesaid position, we reject these applications but with no orders as to costs.
8. Counsel fee for each side is, however, fixed at Rs. 750, if certified.
9. Retain this order in the record of Misc. Civil Case No. 31 of 1993 and place its copy each in the records of the connected Misc. Civil Cases, as particularised above, for ready reference.

"3. the order was assailed by the State by filing Revision Petition before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Shimla, who vide judgment dated 3.3.2016 held that the offence under Section 498-A IPC was a continuing one and the Courts at Shimla had the jurisdiction.
?	""Section 177: ORDINARY PLACE OF INQUIRY AND TRIAL: Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.""
?	14. While in civil cases, normally the expression ""cause of action"" is used, in criminal cases as stated in Section 177 of the Code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed.
?	15. It is settled law that cause of action consists of bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law.
?	""Cause of action"" has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person.
?	20. When the aforesaid legal principles are applied, to the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint petition, the inevitable conclusion is that no part of cause of action arose in Chennai and the concerned magistrate had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter.
?	The appeal is allowed.
?	Going by the complaint, we are of the view that it cannot be held that the Court at Ambikapur has jurisdiction to try the offence since the appropriate Court at Delhi would have jurisdiction to try the said offence.
?	8. Chapter-XIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short Code) relates to jurisdiction of Criminal Courts in inquiries and trials.
?	9. It is apparent from a bare perusal of the aforesaid Section that every offence is required to be ordinarily enquired into and tried by a Court within whose jurisdiction it was committed.
?	The mere fact that warrants of search had been issued by the Court at Kangra would not clothe the Court at Kangra with jurisdiction to entertain the complaint as this would apparently be in violation and conflict with Section 177 of the Code.
?	Blackstone opines that crime is local and jurisdiction over it vests in the Court and Country where the crime is committed.
?	While the convenience of the Defendant in a civil action may be relevant, the convenience of the so called complainant/victim has little or no role to play in criminal prosecution.
?	We reiterate that Section 178 admits of no debate that in criminal prosecution, the concept of cause of action, being the bundle of facts required to be proved in a suit and also being relevant for the place of suing, is not pertinent or germane for determining territorial jurisdiction of criminal Trials.
?	The learned Magistrate at Kangra had no jurisdiction to entertain much less issuing process in the complaint instituted by the respondent No.2.
?	From the allegations in the complaint, it appears to us that it is a continuing offence of illtreatment and humiliation meted out to the appellant in the hands of all the accused persons and in such continuing offence, on some occasion all had taken part and on other occasion one of the accused, namely, husband had taken part undoubtedly clause (c) of Section 178 of the Code is clearly attracted.
?	4. In State of Punjab vs. Dharam Vir Singh Jethi 1994 SCC (Cri.) 500, the Honble Supreme Court held that when the chargesheet was submitted, quashing of FIR is not permissible since it would be open to the Court to refuse to frame charge.
?	We are afraid that the High Court was not right in quashing the First Information Report on the plea that the said respondent had no role to play and was never the custodian of the paddy in question.
?	Section 173(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was filed in the court.
?	5. In Vineet Narain and others vs. Union of India and another (1996) 2 SCC 199, the Supreme Court after refusing to quash the FIR, held that when a chargesheet was filed in the competent Court, it is that Court alone which will then deal with the case on merits, in accordance with law.
?	The legislature in its wisdom under the provisions of the Code has given limited/restrictive power to the Court to intervene at the stage of investigation by the police.
?	No doubt, the appellants have got every right to approach this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C and need not wait for the trial, provided that there is no material to believe, hold or infer that they have not prima facie committed any offence.
?	20. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I find no merit in this petition and the same is dismissed.
?	The interim order passed by this Court on 12.4.2016 is ordered to be vacated.

"Dipak Misra, C.J:? Invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the petitioner has prayed for quashment of the order dated 7.1.2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.-IV, Sheikhpura in Sessions Trial. No. 99 of 2008 whereby he has declined to entertain the petition of the accused-petitioner assailing the jurisdiction of the trial court to proceed with the trial.
2. Bereft of unnecessary details the facts which are required to be exposited for the purpose of adjudication of this application are that the accused petitioner was sent up for trial alongwith others for offences punishable under Sections 304B, 498A, 323, 497, 302, 201, 120B Of the Indian Penal Code and Section ? of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 in Sessions Trial No. 99 of 2008 before the learned Additional Sessions Juge, Fast Track Court No.-IV, Sheikhpura. A petition was filed on 17.11.2009 under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for discharge of the accused persons on the ground that the material on record do not constitute the offences as alleged against the accused person. Another application was filed on 9.12.2009 that the occurrence had taken place at Deoghar in the State of Jharkhand inasmuch as the deceased was staying with her husband, who was working in a Dairy Farm at Deoghar from 2003 and, therefore, the Court at Sheikhpura had no territorial jurisdiction to try the case. The learned Trial Judge rejected the application for discharge on the foundation that there were, prima facie, material on record to implicate the accused petitioner in the crime in question. While dealing with the application pertaining to jurisdiction, the learned trial Judge has expressed the view that on a perusal of the allegations, it would be quite vivid that the place of initiation of the crime in question is Sheikhpura and it ultimately culminated at Deoghar. The trial court in such circumstances came to the conclusion that it had jurisdiction to try the case and accordingly the petition dated 9.12.09 filed by the accused petitioners was rejected.
3. I have heard Mr. Ashwini Kumar Sinha, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Dr. Mayanand. Jha, learned Addi tional Public Prosecutor for the State.
4. It is submitted by Mr. Sinha, learned counsel for the petitioner that the learned Trial Judge has fallen into error by expressing the opinion that he had the territorial jurisdiction to conduct the trial though there is material on record that the alleged occurrence took place at Deoghar in the State of Jharkhand and no real part of cause of action has arisen at Sheikhpura. To bolsfer his submission he has commended me to the decision rendered in Bhura Ram v. State of Rajasthan, 2008 (3) PLJR (SC) 367.
5. Per contra, it is urged by Mr. Jha that the marriage had taken place at Sheikhpura, the demand of dowry and the acts of cruelty had taken place within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court and, hence, it had jurisdiction to try the case despjte the factum that the death had occurred at Deoghar in the State of Jharkhand. It is, also contended by Mr. Jha that the offence under Section 498A I.P.C is a continuing one and the date having nexus with the demand of dowry, the learned Trial Judge has correctly held that he had jurisdiction to try the case.
6. Regard being had to the rivalised submissions raised at the Bar it is seemly to refer to Chapter-XIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (for brevity ?the Code?). It deals with Jurisdiction of Criminal Courts in inquiries and trials. Section 177, which deals with Ordinary place of inquiry and trial, reads as follows:?
?177. Ordinary place of inquiry and trial.?Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and trial by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it Was commit ted.?
7. Section 178 of the Code relates to place of inquiry or trial. The said provision is as follows:?
?178. Place of inquiry or trial.?(a) When it is uncertain in which of several local areas an offence was committed, or
(b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in-another, or
(c) where an offence is a continu ing one, and continues to be commit ted in more local areas than one, or
(d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas,
it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.
8. The aforesaid two provisions came to be interpreted in Y. Abraham Ajith v. Inspector of Police, Chennai, (2004) 8 SCC 100. In the said decision, the Apex Court after referring to the decisions rendered in Purushottamdas Dalmia v. State of W.B, AIR 1961 SC 1589, L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras., AIR 1961 SC 1601, Banwarilal Jhunjhunwala v. Union of India, AIR 1963 SC 1620 and Mohan Baitha v. State of Bihar, (2001) 4 SCC 350 : [2001 (2) PLJR (SC) 83] held that the word ?ordinarily? used in Section 177 has its signification and it indicates that the provision is a, general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Code. It was held therein that in civil cases, normally the expression ?cause of action? is used, in criminal cases as stated in Section. 177 of the Code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed. These variations in etymological expression do not really make the position different and, hence, the expression ?cause of action? in the background of the Code has its own significance. Their Lordships proceeded to deal with the expression ?cause of action? as follows:?
?17. The expression ?cause of action? is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for sitting; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. In, Black's Law Dictionary a ?cause of action? is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which, if traversed; the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In Words and Phrases (4th Edn.), the meaning attributed to the phrase ?cause of action? in common legal parlance is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf.
18. In Hatsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn.) it has been stated., as follows:
?Cause of action has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation, the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. ?Cause of action? has also been taken to mean that a particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject-matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action.?
9. In Bhura Ram (supra) the Apex Court, was dealing with the jurisdiction of the courtto try the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 406 and 147 IPC. Their Lordships after referring to Y. Abraham Ajith (supra) analyzed the facts and eventually held thus:?
?4. The facts stated in the complaint disclose that the complainant left the place where she was residing with her husband and in-laws and came to the city of Sri Ganganagar, State of Rajasthan and that all the alleged acts as per the complaint had taken place in the State of Punjab. The Court at Rajasthan does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. On the basis of the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint, the inevitable conclusion is? that no part of cause of action arose in Rajasthan and, therefore, the Magistrate concerned has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. As a consequence thereof, the proceedings before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sri Ganganagar are quashed. The complaint be returned to the complainant and if she so wishes she may file the same in the appropriate court to be dealt with in accordance with law.?
10. In this context I may refer with profit to the decision rendered in Manish Ratan v. State of M.P, (2007) 1 SCC 262 in the said case the appellant-1 was married with respond ent no. 2 therein in the District of Tikangarh and they were living at their matrimonial home at Jabalpur. A complaint was lodged by the father-in-law of the appellant-1 at the Police Station-Jabalpur alleging that the appellants had been ill-treating his daughter and demanded dowry. The wife lodged another First Information Report against the appellant and others at Police Station-Datia wherein a criminal case was registered. In the said complaint it was stated that the incident, had taken place at Jabalpur. It was mentioned in the com plaint that the wife was ill-treated by the mother-in-law and sister-in-law so much that she left her house and saved her life by some means and reached her uncle's house at Bhopal. An application was moved before the High Court questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of Chief Judi cial Magistrate, Datia. The High Court dis missed the revision holding that the of fence being a continuing one, Datia Court had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence. The Apex Court referred to Sections 177 and ? of the Code and came to hold that in the obtaining factual matrix the offence could not be held to be continuing only because the complainant was forced to leave her matrimonial home.
11. In the case at hand, on the basis of the complaint petition, a direction was issued to set the criminal law in motion by registering a First Information Report, which would reveal that Rinku Devi,: the daughter of the informant went to her matrimonial Village-Gawaya in the year 2003 and the accused-Ganesh Dutt, the husband did not show good behaviour and did not establish marital relationship with his wife and, being influenced by the accused Anshu Devi, her husband Ganesh Dutt often used to assault her. It is also alleged that accused Ganesh Dutt had illicit relationship with his elder brother's wife accused Anshu Devi and, due to the said illicit relationship, Rinku Devi was tortured. It is further alleged. Ganesh Dutt had opened a Dairy Farm at Deoghar with the aid and assistance of Anshu Devi and when the daughter of the informant on 12.3.2006 objected to the illicit relationship between the accused Ganesh Dutt and Anshu Devi, the accused persons assaulted and eventually murdered her.
12. In this factual background it is to be seen whether the cause of action had arisen at Sheikhpura. Submission of Mr. Jha is that 498A offence is a continuing offence and a charge-sheet has been filed in respect of the said offence after a thorough inquiry by the investigating agency.
13. In State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi, (1972) 2 SCC 890 : AIR 1973 SC 908, the Apex Court dealing with the concept of continuing offence expressed the view as follows:?
?5. Continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all. It is one of those offences which arises put of a failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, the liability for which continues until the rule or its requirement is obeyed or complied with. On every occasion that such disobedience or noncompliance occurs and recurs, there is the offence committed. The distinction between the two kinds of offences is between an; act or omission which constitutes an offence once and for all and an act or omission which continues and therefore, constitutes a fresh offence every time or occasion on which it continues. In the case of a continuing offence, there is thus the ingredient of continuance of the offence which is absent in the case of an offence which takes place when an act or omission in committed once and for all.?
14. In Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee, (1997) 5 SCC 30, the Apex Court while dealing with the Offence to be continuing one referred to the specific allegations that had been made against the husband and keeping in view the fact situation set aside the decision of the High Court stating as follows:?
?3. At the hearing of these appeals, Mr. Gambhir, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, has submitted that it will be evident from the complaint that the appellant has alleged that she had been subjected to cruel treatment persistently at Raigarh and also at Raipur and incident taking place at Raipur is not an isolated event, but consequential to the series of incidents taking place at Raigarh. Therefore, the High Court was wrong in appreciating the scope of the complaint and proceeding on the footing that several isolated events had taken place at Raigarh and one isolated incident had taken place at Raipur. Hence, the criminal case filed in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur was only maintainable against the respondent husband against whom some overt act at Raipur was alleged. But such case was not maintainable against the other respondents.?
15. Eventually, their Lordships in paragraph 7 have held as follows:
?7???.We have taken into consideration the complaint filed by the appellant and it appears to us that the complaint reveals a continuing offence? of maltreatment and humiliation meted out to the appellant in the hands of all the accused respondents and in such continuing offence, on some occasions all the respondents had taken part and on other occasion, one of the respond ents had taken part. Therefore, clause (c) of Section 178 of the Code of Crimi nal Procedure is clearly attracted???.?
16. In Ramesh v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2005) 3 SCC 507 : AIR 2005 SC 1989, while dealing with territorial jurisdiction in relation to an offence under Section 498A IPC, the Apex Court had expressed the view thus:?
?11. In the view we are taking, it is not necessary for us to delve into the question of territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Trichy in detail. Suffice it to say that, on looking at the complaint at its face value, the offences alleged cannot be said to have been committed wholly or partly within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court at Trichy. Prima facie, none of the, ingredients constituting the offence can be said to have occurred within the local jurisdiction of that Court. Almost all the allegations pertain to acts of cruelty for the purpose of extracting additional property as dowry while she was in the matrimonial home at Mumbai and the alleged acts of misappropriation of her movable property at Mumbai. However, there is one allegation relevant to Section 498-A from which it could be inferred that one of the acts giving rise to the offence under the said Section had taken place in Chennai. It is alleged that when the relations of the informant met her inlaws at a hotel in Chennai where they were staying on 13.10.1998, there was again a demand for dowry and a threat to torture her in case she was sent back to Mumbai without the money and articles demanded.
12. Thus, the alleged acts which according to the petitioner constitute the offences under Sections 498-A and 406 were done by the accused mostly in Mumbai and partly in Chennai. Prima facie, there is nothing in the entire complaint Which goes to show that any acts constituting the alleged offences were at all committed at Trichy.?
17. I have referred to the aforesaid decision in extenso to appreciate the factual scenario that the place of residence-does not ipso facto give rise to the cause of action. It is worth noting in Manish Ratan. (supra) the Apex Court has held that the term ?ordinarily? has to be construed in terms of the provisions contained in Section 178(c) of the Code.
18. In the obtaining factual matrix, as the allegations would expose, the en tire occurrence had taken place at Deoghar. What is alleged is that at one point of time the husband had come to the in-laws house and had made a demand which was satisfied. In Y. Abraham Ajith (supra), their Lordships after referring to Sujata Mukherjee (Smt.) (supra) and dwelling upon the factual background in the said case distinguished the same by holding as follows:?
?11???But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband on 15.4.1997 on account of alleged dowry demands by the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai. That being so, the logic of Section 178(c) of the Coderelating to continuance of the offences cannot be applied.?
19. In view of the aforesaid analysis I am of the considered opinion that no cause of action had arisen at Sheikhpura and the cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the District of Deoghar in the State of Jharkhand. Though I have, held that the learned Trial Judge did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial that would not be a ground for quashment of the charge-sheet. In this regard I may fruitfully refer to the decision in Satvinder Kaur v. State (Govt. of N.C.T of Delhi), (1999) 8 SCC 728 : AIR 1999 SC 3596, wherein the Apex Court has held as follows:?
?10. It is true that territorial jurisdiction also is prescribed under subsection (1) to the extent that the officer can investigate any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such police station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter-XIII. However, sub-section (2) makes the position clear by providing that no proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered to investigate. After investigation is completed, the result of such investigation is required to be submitted as provided under Ss. 168, 169 and 170. Section 170 specifically provides that if, upon an investigation, it appears to the officer-in-charge of the police station that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer shall, forward the accused under custody to a Magistrate, empowered to take cognizance of the offence upon a police report and to try the accused or commit for trial. Further, if the Investigating Officer arrives at the conclusion that the crime was not committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the police station, then F.I.R can be forwarded to the police station having jurisdiction over the area in which crime is committed. But this would not mean that in a case which requires investigation, the police officer can refuse to record the FIR and/or investigate it.?
20. In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law the order passed by the learned Trial Judge is set aside and it is directed that the learned Trial Judge shall return the charge-sheet to the concerned Investigating Officer for filing it before the court of competent jurisdiction.
21. Resultantly, the application is allowed to the extent indicated above.

"Vinod K. Sharma, J. ? This Criminal Misc. under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been moved for quashing of FIR No. 48 dated 28.4.2006, registered under sections 406/498-A IPC at police station Anandpur Sahib primarily on the ground that the courts at Anandpur Sahib have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the present case.
2. The petitioners are the permanent residents of New Delhi and are residing at House No. C-368, Sarita Vihar, New Delhi. The marriage of petitioner No. I was finalized through a matrimonial column with Ms. Mandeep Kaur daughter of Inderjeet Singh resident of House No. 513, Phase-IV, Mohali District Ropar. In response to the said advertisement the bio-data sent by father of Mandeep Kaur shows that she was working as a teacher in a good reputed school at Mohali. The address given by respondent No. 2 was House No. 517, Phase IV, Mohali District Ropar.
3. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 31.7.2005 at Gurdwara Sri Gurusingh Sabha New Delhi. Respondent No. 2 who is the father of bride had not disclosed to the petitioners that Mandeep Kaur was having a minor daughter of 4 years from her first marriage. A complaint regarding the behaviour of Mandeep Kaur was made by the petitioners on 23.1.2006 at Police Station Sarita Vihar, New Delhi.
4. In the meantime, Mandeep Kaur is said to have got done pregnancy test which was shown to be positive. Mandeep Kaur filed a case against the petitioners for termination of her pregnancy at Delhi.
5. Husband of Mandeep Kaur has filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in the court of District Judge, Delhi on the allegations of cruelty. After filing of matrimonial case respondent No. 2 i.e father of the complainant has got registered a case under sections 406/498-A IPC on the following allegations :?
?To, The Senior Superintendent of Police Distt. Rupnagar, Subject : Regarding demand of dowry and after marriage bearing and torture for bringing more cash. SLR, it is submitted that I Inderjit Singh s/o Sh. Kartar Singh is a resident of Ward No. 1, Near Civil Hospital, Anandpur, I retired from my service two years ago and am now living on my pension. I got my daughter Mandeep Kaur married to Jasjit Singh S/o Balvir Singh Bakshi r/o H.No 368, Pocket - C, Sarita Vihar, New Delhi on 31.7.2005 under the Sikh rites. The marriage was fixed through Newspapers ads. Before the marriage, Mandeep's in-laws had made all the inquiries and after satisfaction only the marriage was held. During the course of meeting before marriage it was said that the marriage will take place with 3 clothes of the girl in a Gurudwara in Chandigarh, we only 5 to 7 members from their side shall attend. But after few days my daughter Mandeep's in-laws forced us to hold the marriage at Delhi saying that the expenses shall be shared by them and we were forced to hold the marriage, 40 guests from Mandeep's in-laws side and 35 guests from our side attended the function. The Restaurant charged Rs. 47,000/- as expenses towards this event. Mandeep's Father-in-law did not pay half as his share. In the marriage, gold jewellery weighing 17 Tolas was given to the girl and her in-laws, which includes the jewellery given to the bride and the groom. The total expenditure, I incurred on my daughter's marriage is approx. 4 lakhs, which includes Rs. 31,000/- in cash for the purchase of furniture. Some days after the marriage, my daughter Mandeep Kaur's husband Jasjit Singh; Father-in-law Balbir Singh, Mother-in-law Bhupinder Kaur; Brother-in-law (Dever) Jaswinder Singh; Sister-in-law (Devrani) Kulwinder Kaur and Jasjit Singh's Mama and Mami first stated torturing her for bringing more money and thereafter beating her. All these events were told to me by daughter and I consoled her and told her not to worry, I shall speak to them. But in October, 2005, my daughter was beaten and thrown out by telling that if you want live in our house bring Rs. 3 lakh more from your father as Jasjit Singh has to return this amount which he has taken loan for giving it towards his divorce to his first wife. After October, 2005, I alongwith my near relative Gurmeet Singh and a friend Jaspal Singh Chopra tried to settle the matter, but these people would not agree and struck to their demand. Thereafter a meeting of both the parties was held at Gurudwara Rakabganj Sahib, Delhi on 8.1.2006 and according to the decision, we handed over Mandeep Kaur to her in-laws and gave the articles worth Rs. 29,000/-, mobile set as per their demand and cash of Rs. 30,000/- was given to Jasjit Singh. But again after few days, Mandeep's in-laws started repeating the same action and on demand my nephew Gurmeet Singh and his wife gave some articles worth Rs. 5000/- and some cash to them on Lohri. Then on 12.2.2006, all the family members of the in-laws left Mandeep Kaur forcibly at one of their relatives. It is, therefore, requested that strict action against the above mentioned members of Mandeep's in-laws family for demanding dowry and Rs. 3 lakh and beating and torturing her be taken, so that justice be meted out to Mandeep my daughter. Thanking you, yours faithfully, Inderjit Singh R/o Ward No. 1, Near Civil Hospital, Anandpur Sahib, Distt. Ropar.?
DDR No. 29 dated 28.4.06 at 10.30 P.M?
6. The petitioners have challenged the registration of FIR and subsequent proceedings primarily on the ground that the Courts at Anandpur Sahib have no jurisdiction and the case has been got registered by respondent No. 2 as resident of Anandpur Sahib, though in the statement of Mandeep Kaur recorded by the police she has shown herself to be the resident of Mohali.
7. The contention of Mr. O.P Goyal, learned senior counsel for the petitioners is that even if the allegations in the FIR are taken on their face value the courts at Anandpur Sahib would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the allegations under section 498-A of the Code as the alleged harassment, if any, was caused to Ms. Mandeep Kaur at Delhi.
8. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners in support of his contention that the court at Anandpur Sahib would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the present FIR placed reliance on the judgment of this court in the case of Amarpreet Kaur? v. State Of Haryana?, 1997 (2) RCR (Crl.) 407 (P&H), wherein this Court has been pleased to lay down as under :?
?16. Similarly, the complaint does not specifically say that the demand for the return of the dowry articles was made at Tohana or that there was an agreement between the parties that the dowry articles, should be returned at Tohana. The dowry articles will normally be with the husband. In the case, the second respondent-complainant and her husband admittedly lived in Chandigarh, whereas the parents-in-law of the complainant lived in the State of Uttar Pradesh. According to the petitioners, the sister-in-law of the complainant - Amarpreet Kaur has also been living only in Uttar Pradesh. Even the complainant has stated in her reply that so long as she and her husband lived at Chandigarh, her sister-in-law Amarpreet Kaur also lived with them. Therefore, it is not as if any of the petitioners lived at Tohana. So we find that while the husband of the complainant is living at Chandigarh, her parents-in-law and sister-in-law are living in Uttar Pradesh. In such circumstances, the demand to return the articles of dowry cannot be said to have been at Tohana. The relevant portion of the allegation in the complainant is as follows :?
?My Istridhan-furniture is with my father-in-law Rajinder Singh and mother-in-law Hamir Kaur which they have kept in their house in U.P Ornaments are with my Nanad (sister of husband). The cash amount is with my husband. They turned out me in three clothes from the house. On asking by my father they refused to return the dowry articles, and myself and my father came back empty-handed.?
These allegations show as if the demand for the return of dowry articles was made at the place of the residence of the petitioners and not at Tohana. Otherwise, the complainant would not have stated that they returned back empty-handed.
17. There is no allegation that the dowry articles are expected to be returned at Tohana. No agreement to that effect is alleged. Simply because the wife lives within the jurisdiction of the Court at Tohana, it cannot be stated that the dowry articles were expected or required to be returned at Tohana.
18. Therefore, taking into consideration all these aspects, I find that the complaint does not show that any part of the cause of action with regard to the offence u/s 406 IPC arose within the territorial limits of the Court at Tohana.
19. So far as cruelty is concerned, the allegations in the complaint read as if the complainant was treated cruelly at Chandigarh only. It has not been stated that the petitioners came to Tohana and ill-treated her. Therefore, it cannot be stated that this alleged offence was committed within the jurisdiction of the Court at Tohana.
20. Therefore, it is evident that the reading of the complaint does not show that the petitioners committed these alleged offences within the jurisdiction of the Court at Tohana and, therefore, the Court at Tohana has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the FIR. The question is whether on this ground, the FIR pending before the Court at Tohana could be quashed even after the filing of the chargesheet and also the framing to the charges by the Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Tohana. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Minakshi Bala v. Sudhir Kumar, 1994 (3) RCR (Crl.) 123 held that the High Court is not justified in invoking its inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the FIR except in rare cases where forensic exigencies and formidable compulsions justify such a course. Therefore, when there are compelling circumstances, this Court can certainly invoke the jurisdiction u/s 482 Cr.P.C to quash the FIR. I have already found that the Court at Tohana has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences alleged. If the Court has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence, there is no use of allowing the proceedings to continue since the Court at Tohana cannot convict the accused ultimately even if the charges against the accused petitioners are proved. Therefore in these circumstances, I find that there is no use of allowing the FIR to continue as it will be a sheet waste of time and unnecessary expenditure. Therefore, the FIR and consequential proceedings will have to be quashed.?
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners also placed reliance on the judgment of this court in the case of Sanjay Khosla? v. Smt. Sumina?., 1997 (3) RCR (Crl.) 666 which is also to the same effect as the judgment referred to above.
9. Mr. O.P Goyal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners thereafter placed reliance on the judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of Mohan Lal and others v. State, 2000 (2) RCR (Crl.) 534, wherein Hon'ble Delhi High Court has been pleased to lay down as under :?
?8. The venue of injury or trial is primarily determined by the averments made in the complaint of charge-sheet. It is not disputed that the marriage between the parties had taken place at Village Jawali, Distt. Kangra, Himachal Pradesh and the parties had also lived together in the matrimonial home there. In the complaint also it is alleged that the acts of cruelty had taken place at the matrimonial home. The complaint does not show that acts of cruelty had taken place at Delhi, nor the report under Section 173 Cr.P.Cdisclosed if any cause of action or any act of cruelty had taken place at Delhi. It is thus not the case of the prosecution in the charge-sheet that the husband or any member of the family had actually caused any act of cruelty at Delhi. The learned M.M In his order dated 23.6.1995 has not dealt with this respect. The learned ASJ has noticed that though the marriage was solemnized at Himachal Pradesh and the wife was also subjected to cruelty there but the offence of cruelty is a continuing offence and as such the part of the cruelty had continued in Delhi.
9. An act will be continuing offence where the act is an offence and by continuing that act from day today a fresh offence is committed by the accused. In the present case the alleged act or acts of cruelty had taken place in (District Kangra) Himachal Pradesh at the matrimonial home of the complainant. These acts of cruelty came to end as soon as the complainant left her matrimonial home and came to Delhi and started living at her parents' house. The alleged acts of cruelty committed at her matrimonial home cannot be said to have continued at Delhi. Section 178 of the Code does not apply to case where the whole offence is committed within one jurisdiction. The learned A.S.J, thus was not right in his view that the cruelty in this case was a continuing offence the impugned order to this extent is not legal and valid and is not sustainable.?
10. Reliance has also been placed by the petitioner on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. v. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr., 2004 (3) RCR (Crl.) 988 : 2004 (3) Apex Crl. 455 : AIR 2004 SC 4286 wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has been pleased to lay down as under :?
?Sections 177 to 186 deal with venue and place of trial. Section 177 reiterates the well-established common law rule referred to in Halsbury's Law of England (Vol. IX para 83) that the proper and ordinary venue for the trial of a crime is the area of jurisdiction in which, on the evidence, the facts occur and which alleged to constitute the crime. There are several exceptions to this general rule and some of them are, so far as the present case is concerned, indicated in Section 178 of the Code which reads as follows :
?Section 178 PLACE OF INQUIRY OR TRIAL :
(a) When it is uncertain in which of several local areas an offence was committed, or (b) where an offence is committed partly in one local area and partly in another, or (c) where an offence is continuing one, and continues to be committed in more local areas than one, or (d) where it consists of several acts done in different local areas, it may be inquired into or tried by a Court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.?
?All crime is local, the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed? as observed by Blackstone. A significant word used in Section 177 of the Code is ?ordinarily?. Use of the word indicates that the provision is a general one and must be read subject to the special provisions contained in the Code. As observed by the Court in Purshottamdas Dalmia v. State of West Bengal, (AIR 1961 SC 1589), L. N. Mukherjee v. State Of Madras., (AIR 1961 SC 1601), Banwarilal Jhunhunwalla and Ors. v. Union of India and Anr., (AIR 1963 SC 1620) and Mohan Baitha and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Anr., 2001 (2) RCR (Crl.) 381 : (2001 (4) SCC 350, exception implied by the word ?ordinarily? need not be limited to those specially provided for by the law and exceptions may be provided by law on consideration or may be implied from the provisions of law permitting joint trial of offences by the same Court. No such exception is applicable to the case at hand.
As observed by this Court in State of Bihar v. Deokaran Nenshi and Anr., (AIR 1973 SC 908) continuing offence is one which is susceptible of continuance and is distinguishable from the one which is committed once and for all, that it is one of those offences which arises out of the failure to obey or comply with a rule or its requirement and which involves a penalty, liability continues till compliance, that on every occasion such disobedience or non-compliance occurs or recurs, there is the offence committed.
A similar plea relating to continuance of the offence was examined by this Court in Sujata Mukherjee (Smt) v. Prashant Kumar Mukherjee, 1997 (3) RCR (Crl.) 198 : (1997 (5) SCC 30). There all allegations related to commission of alleged offence punishable under Sections 498A, 506 and 323 IPC. On the factual background, it was noted that though the dowry demands were made earlier the husband of the complainant went to the place where complainant was residing and had assaulted her. This Court held in that factual background that clause (c) of Section 178 was attracted. But in the present case the factual position is different and the complainant herself left the house of the husband and his relations. There is thereafter not even a whisper of allegations about any demand of dowry or commission of any act constituting an offence much less at Chennai. That being so, the logic of Section 178(c) of the Coderelating to continuance of the offences cannot be applied. The crucial question is whether any part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the concerned Court. In terms of Section 177 of the Code it is the place where the offence was committed. In essence it is the cause of action for initiation of the proceedings against the accused.
Where in civil cases, normally the expression ?cause of action? is issued, in criminal cases as stated in Section 177 of the Code, reference is to the local jurisdiction where the offence is committed. The expression ?cause of action? is therefore not a stranger to criminal cases.
It is settled law that cause of action consists of bundle of facts, which give cause to enforce the legal inquiry for redress in a court of law. In other words, it is bundle of facts, which taken with the law applicable to them, gives the allegedly affected partly a right to claim relief against the opponent. It must include some act done by the latter since in the absence of such an act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would arise.
The expression ?cause of action? has acquired a judicially settled meaning. In the restricted sense cause of action means the circumstances forming the infraction of the right of the immediate occasion for the action. In the wider sense, it means the necessary conditions for the maintenance of the proceeding including not only alleged infraction, but also the infraction coupled with the right itself. Compendiously the expression means every fact, which it would be necessary for the complainant to prove, it traversed, in order to support his right or grievance to the judgment of the Court. Every fact, which is necessary to be proved, as distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is necessary to prove such fact, comprises in ?cause of action?.
The expression ?cause of action? has sometimes been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which constitute either the infringement or the basis of a right and no more. In a wider and more comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote the whole bundle of material facts.
The expression ?cause of action? is generally understood to mean a situation or state of facts that entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more bases for sitting; a factual situation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in court from another person. (Black's Law Dictionary a ?cause of action? is stated to be the entire set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the phrase comprises every fact, which, if traversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment. In ?Words and Phrases? (4th Edn.) the meaning attributed to the phrase ?cause of action? in common legal parlance is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to judicial interference on his behalf.
In Halsbury Laws of England (Forth Edition) it has been stated as follows :
?Cause of action? has been defined as meaning simply a factual situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the Court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been held from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a defendant would have a right to traverse. ?Cause of action? has also been taken to mean that particular act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject matter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical cause of action?.
When the aforesaid legal principles are applied, to the factual scenario disclosed by the complainant in the complaint petition, the inevitable conclusion is that no part of cause of action arose in Chennai and, therefore, the concerned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The proceedings are quashed. The complaint be returned to respondent No. 2 who, if she so chooses, may file the same in the appropriate Court to be dealt with in accordance with law. The appeal is accordingly allowed.?
11. On the other hand learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents placed reliance on the judgment of this court in the case of Brij Lal? v. State Of Haryana?, 1997 (3) RCR (Crl.) 319; Sita Ram v. State of Haryana, 1997 (2) RCR (Crl.) 602; Sandeep Aggarwal v. Sudesh Gupta, 1997 (2) R.C.R (Crl.) 322 and Mandeep Singh v. State of Punjab, 1997 (2) RCR (Crl.) 154.
12. In all these cases this court has been pleased to lay down that in offence under sections 406 and 498-A IPC courts where the brides reside have the jurisdiction to try the offence.
13. Learned counsel for the respondents also placed reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of Pritam Singh & Ors. v. State Of Delhi & Anr, 2000 (4) RCR (Criminal) 566 (Delhi); a judgment of Hon'ble Andhra Pradesh in the case of Syed Khaja Mohiuddin v. State of A.P, 2005 (4) RCR (Crl.) 548and a judgment of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Raginiben Gunvantsinh Tank v. Gunvantlal Keshavlal Tank and others, 2003 (4) RCR (Crl.) 451 In all these cases it has been held that the courts where the bride resides have the jurisdiction to entertain and try the case.
14. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that as respondent No. 2 was residing at Anadpur Sahib and Mandeep Kaur has been residing at Anandpur Sahib as well as Mohali, the courts at Anandpur Sahib have jurisdiction.
15. The judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents cannot be said to be laying down good law in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Manish Ratna and others v. State of M.P, 2007 (1) RCR (Crl.) 513 : 2007 (1) RAJ 355 : (2007) 1 Supreme Court Cases 262 which lays down as under :?
?Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 - Sections 178(c) & 177 and 406 - Place of inquiry and trial - Continuing offence - Territorial jurisdiction of court - Appellant 1 married with Respondent 2 and living in matrimonial home at Jabalpur (MP) - Appellant 1?s father-in-law lodged a complaint with police at Jabalpur alleging ill-treatment to Respondent 2 and demand of dowry from her by Appellant 1 and his family members (appellants) - Respondent 2 also lodged FIR alleging that her husband and in-laws ill-treated her so much that she had to leave the matrimonial home and to live with her parents at Datia (MP) - Whether the offence was a continuing one such that CJM at Datia had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence - Held, offence cannot be said to be continuing one only because complainant Respondent 2 was forced to leave her matrimonial home and stayed with her parents at Datia - High Court erred in taking the view that Respondent 2 having been forced to leave her matrimonial home on account of torture by her in-laws, it amounted to mental cruelty and harassment which continued even at the place of her father at Datia and therefore, the offence may be inquired into and tried also at Datia court - In view of Section 177, which ordains that offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed the offence in question must be inquired into and tried by court at Jabalpur and not by court at Datia where no part of cause of action arose - Therefore, interest of justice would be subserved, while setting aside the order of the High Court, if in exercise of Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution transfer of the criminal case pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Datia to the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jabalpur is directed - Constitution of India Article 142.?
16. On consideration of the matter, I find force in the contentions raised by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners. In the present case for allegations constituting an offence under section 498-A IPC the court where Istridhan is required to be returned would have the jurisdiction in that event also the court at Anandpur Sahib would have no jurisdiction as Mandeep Kaur is residing at Mohali and not at Anandpur Sahib. Respondent No. 2 could not maintain a complaint with regard to an offence under Section 406 IPC though relatives can maintain a petition under section 498-A IPC.
17. Filing of FIR at Anandpur Sahib seems to be a mala fide attempt on the part of respondent No. 2 due to his influence at the said place, where he was posted as an officer of the bank.
18. Be that as it may, in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. v. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr. (supra) the courts at Anandpur Sahib would have no jurisdiction to entertain and try the FIR in question and therefore, this petition deserves to be allowed.
19. Though in the case of Manish Ratan and others v. State of M.P, (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court ordered the transfer of criminal case to the competent court having jurisdiction but in the present case as prima facie jurisdiction would be with the courts at Delhi, I feel it would be appropriate to follow the judgment in the case of Y. Abraham Ajith & Ors. v. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr. (supra) and order that the complaint filed by the complainant be returned to the complainant for presentation in the court of competent jurisdiction.
Petition allowed.

"1. Leave granted.
2. These two appeals arise from a common order dated 05.05.2017, directing retrospective consideration for promotion of the respondents to the post of SecondinCommand and Commandant respectively, in the Border Security Force (BSF), from the date that their juniors had been promoted, along with all consequential benefits.
3. The respondents in the two writ petitions were superseded in the years 1996 and 2000, respectively. Both of them were subsequently promoted on 28.11.1997 and 16.06.2003 as SecondinCommand and Commandant respectively. Subsequently, both of them submitted several representations for promotion from the date of supersession. Orders rejecting the representations, along with reasons, were duly communicated to them more than once. After the pronouncement in Sukhdev Singh vs. Union of India & ors., (2013) 9 SCC 566 affirming Dev Dutt vs. Union of India & ors., (2008) 8 SCC 725, separate writ petitions were filed by them on 25.09.2016. The common plea taken was that the entry 'good' in their annual confidential reports (ACRs) for the relevant years was an adverse remark in view of the benchmark of 'very good'. Since the adverse entry had not been communicated to them, it could not be taken into consideration, requiring reconsideration for promotion from the date of supersession.
4. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the claims of the respondents were highly belated and stale. The writ petitions ought to have been dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. Specific objection had been taken in the counter affidavit, including the cascading effect that it would have had upon those promoted earlier to the respondents, and which would lead to administrative chaos. Mere filing of representations or a subsequent judgement, could not be sufficient justification to entertain such belated claims, dehors the facts of a case. The High Court ought not to have given directions to consider their candidature with retrospective effect.
5. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that enunciation of law by this Court will always have to be given retrospective effect, unless it is made prospective specifically. The grading 'good' in the facts of the case was adverse as the benchmark for promotion was 'very good'. In view of the law laid down in Dev Dutt (supra) as affirmed in Sukhdev Singh (supra), it was mandatory for the appellants to have communicated such adverse remarks to the respondents. In absence of such communication, these remarks could not have been considered to deny promotions. The respondents were genuinely and bonafide pursuing their grievances before the authorities themselves, hoping that they would see reason, and only when they realised that relief would not be forthcoming otherwise, they approached the High Court ultimately.
6. We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties. The only question for consideration is the applicability of the law as declared in Dev Dutt (supra) and affirmed in Sukhdev Singh (supra) to the respondents in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
7. The benchmark for promotion to the posts in question under the BSF (Seniority, Promotion and Superannuation of Officers) Rules of 1978, as prescribed in paramilitary Promotion DO letter dated 25.11.1988 was modified on 08.05.1990 from 'Good' to 'Very Good'. The respondent Chaman Rana, a Deputy Commandant was considered for promotion to the rank of SecondinCommand at the departmental promotion committee (DPC) meeting held on 13.09.1996 but could not make the grade in view of the criteria prescribed in DO letter dated 08.05.1990. The respondent represented on 20.02.1997 against his supersession. An order of rejection with reasons was communicated to him on 25.03.1997. The cause of action had, therefore, accrued to seek relief before a court of law. Nonetheless a repeat representation was made on 31.07.1997, and a reasoned rejection was again communicated on 07.05.1998. In the meantime, the respondent was empanelled to be considered for promotion to the rank of SecondinCommand by the DPC held in the year 1997, and he was promoted as such on 28.11.1997. A cause of action again accrued to the respondent for approaching the Court for relief but he again represented on 30.06.1998, followed by further representations on 14.09.1998, 22.08.2000, 22.08.2006. A fresh reasoned order of rejection was again communicated on 16.05.2007. Repeat representations followed on 28.08.2012, 07.11.2015 and 20.11.2015 after which the writ petition came to be instituted.
8. Likewise, the respondent Gulshan Kumar Sharma was considered for promotion as Commandant in the years 20002001 and 20012002 by the DPC but was superseded as he failed to secure the benchmark. He represented on 25.10.2001 and was informed on 09.01.2002 that he had failed to secure the benchmark. The cause of action to approach the Court for grant of relief had accrued to the respondent but he again represented on 18.03.2002.
An order of rejection along with reasons was again communicated to him on 01.09.2004. After he was promoted as Commandant on 16.06.2003, instead of approaching the Court, he again represented on 04.05.2005, followed by another representation on 08.01.2007. A reasoned order of rejection was again communicated to him on 17.04.2008. This was followed by further representation on 11.08.2009 which was again rejected on 02.09.2009 allegedly communicated on 01.01.2016. A further representation dated 03.08.2015 was also rejected on 27.11.2015. The writ petition then came to be instituted.
9. Manifestly, the cause of action first arose to the respondents on the date of initial supersession and again on the date when rejection of their representation was communicated to them, or within reasonable time thereafter. Even if the plea based on Dev Dutt (supra) be considered, the cause of action based thereon accrued on 12.05.2008. There has to be a difference between a cause of action and what is perceived as materials in support of the cause of action. In service matters, especially with regard to promotion, there is always an urgency.
The aggrieved must approach the Court at the earliest opportunity, or within a reasonable time thereafter as third party rights accrue in the meantime to those who are subsequently promoted. Such persons continue to work on the promotional post, ensconced in their belief of the protection available to them in service with regard to seniority. Any belated interference with the same is bound to have adverse effect on those already promoted affecting their morale in service also. Additionally, any directions at a belated stage to consider others for promotion with retrospective effect, after considerable time is bound to have serious administrative implications apart from the financial burden on the government that would follow by such orders of promotion.
10. As far back as in P.S. Sadasivaswamy vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, (1975) 1 SCC 152, considering a claim for promotion belated by 14 years, this Court had observed that a period of six months or at the utmost a year would be reasonable time to approach a court against denial of promotion and that it would be a sound and wise exercise of discretion not to entertain such claims by persons who tried to unsettle the settled matters, which only clog the work of the court impeding it in considering genuine grievances within time in the following words :""
2..... A person aggrieved by an order of promoting a junior over his head should approach the Court at least within six months or at the most a year of such promotion. It is not that there is any period of limitation for the Courts to exercise their powers under Article 226 nor is it that there can never be a case where the Courts cannot interfere in a matter after the passage of a certain length of time. But it would be a sound and wise exercise of discretion for the Courts to refuse to exercise their extraordinary powers under Article 226 in the case of persons who do not approach it expeditiously for relief and who stand by and allow things to happen and then approach the Court to put forward stale claims and try to unsettle settled matters.
The petitioner's petition should, therefore, have been dismissed in limine. Entertaining such petitions is a waste of time of the Court. It clogs the work of the Court and impedes the work of the Court in considering legitimate grievances as also its normal work. We consider that the High Court was right in dismissing the appellant's petition as well as the appeal.""
11. Mere repeated filing of representations could not be sufficient explanation for delay in approaching the Court for grant of relief, was considered in Gandhinagar Motor Transport Society vs. State of Bombay, A.I.R. 1954 Bombay 202, by Chief Justice Chagla, observing as follows :
""(2)...... Now, we have had occasion to point out that the only delay which this Court will excuse in presenting a petition is the delay which is caused by the petitioner pursuing a legal remedy which is given to him. In this particular case the petitioner did not pursue a legal remedy. The remedy he pursued was extralegal or extrajudicial. Once the final decision of government is given, a representation is merely an appeal for mercy or indulgence, but it is not pursuing a remedy which the law gave to the petitioner...""
12. The appellant, in its counter affidavit before the High Court, had specifically taken the objection that the claim was highly belated, and that any direction for a retrospective consideration would have a destabilising effect in unsettling the settled position which would lead to complete chaos apart from other administrative consequences. The High Court failed to consider the objection. In Union of India vs. M.K. Sarkar, (2010) 2 SCC 59, this Court observed as follows:""
16. A court or tribunal, before directing 'consideration' of a claim or representation should examine whether the claim or representation is with reference to a 'live' issue or whether it is with reference to a 'dead' or 'stale' issue. If it is with reference to a 'dead' or 'stale' issue or dispute, the court/tribunal should put an end to the matter and should not direct consideration or reconsideration....""
13. In Dev Dutt (supra), the DPC was held on 16.12.1994. The appellant therein, aggrieved by his supersession moved the High Court with utmost expedition leading to the pronouncement by the Single Judge on 21.08.2001 and by the Division Bench on 26.11.2001. The appeal was instituted before this Court in the year 2002. If that were not sufficient to distinguish the case of the respondents, reference may also be made to the observations in paragraph 36 as follows:
""36. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice by holding that fairness and transparency in public administration requires that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in the annual confidential report of a public servant, whether in civil, judicial, police or any other State service (except the military), must be communicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a representation for its upgradation.""
14. The High Court erred in placing absolute reliance on Dev Dutt (supra) and Sukhdev (supra) without noticing the fact situation of the respondents. In Union of India and another vs. Major Bahadur Singh, (2006) (1) SCC 368, it was observed:""
9. The courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of the courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of the courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments....""
15. A subsequent pronouncement by this Court could not enthuse a fresh lease of life, or furnish a fresh cause of action to what was otherwise clearly a dead and stale claim. In State of Uttaranchal vs. Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari, (2013) 12 SCC 179, it was observed that :""
29.... Not for nothing, has it been said that everything may stop but not the time, for we are all slaves of time. There may not be any provision providing for limitation but a grievance relating to promotion cannot be given a new lease of life at any point of time.""
16. The observations with regard to the modus operandi of the representation syndrome to revive what are clearly dead and stale claims as discussed in C. Jacob vs. Director of Geology and Mining, (2008) 10 SCC 115, and the caution to be exercised by the Court are also considered apposite in the facts of the present case.
17. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, any direction to consider retrospective promotion of the respondents at such a belated passage of time of over 17 to 20 years, would virtually bring a tsunami in the service resulting in administrative chaos quite apart from the financial implications for the government. The order of the High Court is therefore held to be unsustainable and is set aside.
18. Both the appeals are allowed for the aforesaid reasons.

"1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant, insurance company, is in appeal by special leave against the judgment and order dated 23.03.2011 whereby the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court allowed the review petition and reviewed its order dated 09.11.2010 and held that the insurance company was liable to pay compensation in sum of Rs. 2,88,000/- with 9% interest thereon to the claimant awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in its award dated 23.07.2002.
3. The question of law that arises in this appeal is as to whether having regard to the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short,'1988 Act'), the insurance company is liable to pay compensation for the bodily injury caused to the claimant who was travelling in a goods vehicle as a spare driver though he was employed as a driver in another vehicle owned by the owner of the vehicle under the policy of insurance.
4. The above question arises in this way. Saju P. Paul, claimant(Respondent No. 1), was a heavy vehicle driver. He was employed with Respondent No. 2 as a driver in some other vehicle. On 16.10.1993, he was travelling in a goods vehicle bearing No. KL-2A/3411 in the cabin. The goods vehicle was being driven by one Jayakumar. In that vehicle, many other persons were also travelling. At Nilackal, due to rash and negligent driving of the driver Jayakumar, the goods vehicle capsized. As a result of which the claimant suffered fracture and injuries. The claimant remained under treatment for quite some time and the injuries that he sustained in the accident rendered him permanently disabled. In the claim petition filed by him before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Pathanamthitta (for short, 'the Tribunal'), he claimed compensation ofRs.3,00,000/-. The owner and insurer were impleaded as respondent no. 2and respondent no. 3 respectively in the claim petition.
5. The insurer filed its written statement and opposed the claimant's claim insofar as it was concerned. The insurer set up the plea that the vehicle was a goods vehicle and the risk of the passengers travelling in the goods vehicle was not covered under the policy of insurance. It was stated in the written statement that nearly 50unauthorised passengers were travelling at the time of accident; they were not traveling in the vehicle in pursuance of the contract of employment, such as loading and unloading nor they were travelling as the owner of the goods or the representative of the owner of the goods and hence the insurer could not be saddled with any liability.
6. The Tribunal, after recording the evidence and hearing the parties, on 23.07.2002, passed an award in favour of the claimant holding that he was entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/-. The liability of the insurer was made joint and several with the owner anddriver.
7. Being not satisfied with the award of the Tribunal, the insurer filed an appeal before the Kerala High Court. The Division Bench of that Court by relying upon decisions of this Court in New India Assurance Co.Ltd. v. Asha Rani and others[1] and National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Cholleti Bharatamma and Others[2] allowed the appeal of the insurer vide judgment and order dated 09.11.2010. The Division Bench held that insurer was not liable as gratuitous passengers travelling in a goods vehicle were not covered under the policy and the claimant shall be entitled to recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver of the vehicle.
8. The claimant sought review of the order dated 09.11.2010 and, as noted above, by the impugned order that review application has been allowed. While allowing the review application, the Division Bench held asunder: ""It has already been noticed that the petitioner was admittedly a spare driver of the vehicle. It may be true that he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant point of time; but he was directed to go to the worksite by his employer as a spare driver in the vehicle. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the petitioner was not travelling in the vehicle in the course of his employment and as directed by his employer. Section 147(1)(b)(i) takes within its fold any liability which may be incurred by the insurer in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person. Therefore, the argument of the insurance company that no goods were being carried in the vehicle at the time of accident and therefore, the petitioner was only a gratuitous passenger cannot be countenanced at all. Even otherwise, the first proviso to Section147(1) will cast a liability on the insurer to indemnify the owner in respect of the injury sustained by the employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment.
9. "" It is appropriate to quote Section 147 of the 1988 Act as was obtaining on the date of accident, i.e., 16.10.1993, which reads as follows: ""147. Requirements of policies and limits of liability.-
(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a policy of insurance must be a policy which-
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorized insurer; and
(b) insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)-
(i) against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required-
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out of and in the course of his employment, of the employee of a person insured by the policy or in respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923), in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee-
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as a conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability. Explanation.- For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party shall be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured or the property which is damaged was not in a public place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission which led to the accident occurred in a public place.
(2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits, namely- (a) save as provided in clause (b), the amount of liability incurred;
(b) in respect of damage to any property of a third party, a limit of rupees six thousand: Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any limited liability and in force, immediately before the commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a period of four months after such commencement or till the date of expiry of such policy whichever is earlier.
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in different cases.
(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the provisions of this Chapter or the rules made there under is not followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time, the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the cover note relates has been registered or to such other authority as the State Government may prescribe. (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those classes of persons.
10. ""By the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994 (for short, '1994Amendment Act'), Section 147 came to be amended. The expression ""including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle"" was added in Section 147. The amended Section 147 has been considered by this Court in various decisions, some of which we intend to refer a little later.
11. In New India Assurance Company v. Satpal Singh and others [3],this Court with reference to the provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act,1939 and the provisions in 1988 Act, particularly Section 147, held that under the 1988 Act an insurance policy covering third party risk was not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in a vehicle no matter that the vehicle is of any type or class. It was also held that the earlier decisions of this Court rendered under the 1939 Act vis-? -vis gratuitous passengers were of no avail while considering the liability of the insurance company in respect of any accident which occurred or would occur after the 1988 Act came into force.
12. The correctness of the judgment in Satpal Singh3 was doubted, inter alia, in Asha Rani1. It was felt that Satpal Singh3 needed re-look insofar as cases covered under the 1988 Act prior to its amendment in 1994were concerned. A three-Judge Bench in Asha Rani1 noticed Section 147 of the 1988 Act prior to its amendment in 1994 and after its amendment in 1994and held in paragraph 9 of the Report (Pgs. 231-232) as follows : ""In Satpal case [(2000) 1 SCC 237] the Court assumed that the provisions of Section 95(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 are identical with Section 147(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as it stood prior to its amendment.
But a careful scrutiny of the provisions would make it clear that prior to the amendment of 1994 it was not necessary for the insurer to insure against the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle. On an erroneous impression this Court came to the conclusion that the insurer would be liable to pay compensation in respect of the death or bodily injury caused to either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative when being carried in a goods vehicle the accident occurred. If the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act of 1994 is examined, particularly Section 46, by which the expression ""injury to any person"" in the original Act stood substituted by the expression ""injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle"", the conclusion is irresistible that prior to the aforesaid Amendment Act of 1994, even if the widest interpretation is given to the expression ""to any person"" it will not cover either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in the vehicle.
The objects and reasons of clause 46 also state that it seeks to amend Section 147 to include owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle for the purposes of liability under the insurance policy. It is no doubt true that sometimes the legislature amends the law by way of amplification and clarification of an inherent position which is there in the statute, but a plain meaning being given to the words used in the statute, as it stood prior to its amendment of 1994, and as it stands subsequent to its amendment in 1994 and bearing in mind the objects and reasons engrafted in the amended provisions referred to earlier, it is difficult for us to construe that the expression ""including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle"" which was added to the pre-existing expression ""injury to any person"" is either clarificatory or amplification of the pre-existing statute.
On the other hand it clearly demonstrates that the legislature wanted to bring within the sweep of Section 147 and making it compulsory for the insurer to insure even in case of a goods vehicle, the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle met with an accident and the owner of the goods or his representative either dies or suffers bodily injury. The judgment of this Court in Satpal case therefore must be held to have not been correctly decided and the impugned judgment of the Tribunal as well as that of the High Court accordingly are set aside and these appeals are allowed. It is held that the insurer will not be liable for paying compensation to the owner of the goods or his authorised representative on being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle meets with an accident and the owner of the goods or his representative dies or suffers any bodily injury.
13. ""S.B. Sinha, J. in his supplementary judgment in Asha Rani1 ,while concurring with the above, observed as follows (Pg. 235): ""26. In view of the changes in the relevant provisions in the 1988 Act vis-? -vis the 1939 Act, we are of the opinion that the meaning of the words ""any person"" must also be attributed having regard to the context in which they have been used i.e. ""a third party"". Keeping in view the provisions of the 1988 Act, we are of the opinion that as the provisions thereof do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger travelling in a goods vehicle, the insurers would not be liable there for.
27. Furthermore, sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 147 speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place, whereas sub-clause (ii) thereof deals with liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place.
28. An owner of a passenger-carrying vehicle must pay premium for covering the risks of the passengers. If a liability other than the limited liability provided for under the Act is to be enhanced under an insurance policy, additional premium is required to be paid. But if the ratio of this Court's decision in New India Assurance Co. v. Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] is taken to its logical conclusion, although for such passengers, the owner of a goods carriage need not take out an insurance policy, they would be deemed to have been covered under the policy where for even no premium is required to be paid.
14. Asha Rani1 has been relied upon in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.v. Devireddy Konda Reddy and Others[4] wherein it was held as under (Pgs.342-343): ""The difference in the language of ""goods vehicle"" as appearing in the old Act and ""goods carriage"" in the Act is of significance. A bare reading of the provisions makes it clear that the legislative intent was to prohibit goods vehicle from carrying any passenger. This is clear from the expression ""in addition to passengers"" as contained in the definition of ""goods vehicle"" in the old Act. The position becomes further clear because the expression used is ""goods carriage"" is solely for the carriage of ""goods"". Carrying of passengers in a goods carriage is not contemplated in the Act.
There is no provision similar to clause (ii) of the proviso appended to Section 95 of the old Act prescribing requirement of insurance policy. Even Section 147 of the Act mandates compulsory coverage against death of or bodily injury to any passenger of ""public service vehicle"". The proviso makes it further clear that compulsory coverage in respect of drivers and conductors of public service vehicle and employees carried in goods vehicle would be limited to liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (in short ""the WC Act""). There is no reference to any passenger in ""goods carriage"".14.1. Then in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Report (Pg. 343), this Court held in Devireddy Konda Reddy4 as under : ""10. The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that provisions of the Act do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger travelling in a goods carriage and the insurer would have no liability there for.
11. Our view gets support from a recent decision of a three- Judge Bench of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asha Rani [(2003) 2 SCC 223] in which it has been held that Satpal Singh case [(2000) 1 SCC 237] was not correctly decided. That being the position, the Tribunal and the High Court were not justified in holding that the insurer had the liability to satisfy the award.
15. ""In Cholleti Bharatamma2, this Court was concerned with the question about the liability of the insurance company to indemnify the owner of the vehicle in respect of death of passengers travelling in goods vehicle. The Court considered the applicability of Section 147 as it originally stood under 1988 Act and after its amendment in 1994. In relation to the accident that occurred on 16.12.1993 i.e., prior to the1994 amendment in SLP(C) 7237-39/2003, this Court set aside the judgment of the High Court and allowed the appeal of the insurance company by observing as follows (Pg. 430):
""14. The date of accident being 16-12-1993, the amendment carried out in the year 1994 in Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act would not be applicable. 15. The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Nalgonda, by a judgment and award dated 13-11-1997 awarded various sums overruling the defence of the appellant herein that they were unauthorised passengers. The High Court, however, by reason of the impugned judgment, relying on or on the basis of a decision of this Court in Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] directed as under:
""The learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that the issue involved in these appeals is squarely covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237], wherein Their Lordships held that under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 all insurance policies covering third-party risks are not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in the vehicle though vehicle is of any type or class. In view of the proposition of law laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision stated supra, these appeals are dismissed. No costs.""
16. Following the aforementioned principles, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained which is set aside. The appeals are allowed accordingly.""15.1. With reference to the accident that took place on 24.12.1993(prior to 1994 amendment) in SLP(C) Nos. 7241-43/2003, this Court in Cholleti Bharatamma 2 in paragraphs 17,18,19,20 and 21 (Pgs. 430-431) held as under :
17. ""In the aforementioned case, accident took place on 24-12- 1993. The respondents herein filed a claim petition claiming compensation for the death of one Kota Venkatarao who had allegedly paid a sum of Rs 20 for travelling in the lorry. The Tribunal held: ""In the absence of rebuttal evidence from the deceased and some others who travelled in the said vehicle in the capacity of owner of the luggage which was carried by them at the time of accident, it cannot be said that it is a violation of the policy, since it is not fundamental breach so as to afford to the insurer to eschew the liability altogether as per the decision in B.V. Nagaraju v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. [(1996) 4 SCC 647 : AIR 1996 SC 2054]""
18. The High Court, however, relying upon Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] opined: ""This issue raised in this appeal is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Satpal Singh wherein Their Lordships held that under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 all insurance policies covering third-party risks are not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in the vehicles though the vehicle is of any type or class. Following the same, the appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.""
19. It is now well settled that the owner of the goods means only the person who travels in the cabin of the vehicle.
20. In this case, the High Court had proceeded on the basis that they were gratuitous passengers. The admitted plea of the respondents themselves was that the deceased had boarded the lorry and paid an amount of Rs 20 as transport charges. It has not been proved that the deceased was travelling in the lorry along with the driver or the cleaner as the owner of the goods. Travelling with the goods itself does not entitle anyone to protection under Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
21. For the reasons aforementioned, this appeal is allowed.""16. In the present case, Section 147 as originally existed in 1988Act is applicable and, accordingly, the judgment of this Court in AshaRani1 is fully attracted. The High Court was clearly in error in reviewing its judgment and order delivered on 09.11.2010 in review petition filed by the claimant by applying Section 147(1)(b)(i). The High Court committed grave error in holding that Section 147(1)(b)(i) takes within its fold any liability which may be incurred by the insurer in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person.
The High Court also erred in holding that the claimant was travelling in the vehicle in the course of his employment since he was a spare driver in the vehicle although he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant time but he was directed to go to the worksite by his employer. The High Court erroneously assumed that the claimant died in the course of employment and overlooked the fact that the claimant was not in any manner engaged on the vehicle that met with an accident but he was employed as a driver in another vehicle owned by M/s. P.L. Construction Company. The insured (owner of the vehicle) got insurance cover in respect of the subject goods vehicle for driver and cleaner only and not for any other employee.
There is no insurance cover for the spare driver in the policy. As a matter of law, the claimant did not cease to be a gratuitous passenger though he claimed that he was a spare driver. The insured had paid premium for one driver and one cleaner and, therefore, second driver or for that purpose 'spare driver' was not covered under thepolicy.
17. The High Court misconstrued the proviso following sub-section(1) of Section 147 of the 1988 Act. What is contemplated by proviso to Section 147 (1) is that the policy shall not be required to cover liability in respect of death or bodily injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923. The claimant was admittedly not driving the vehicle nor was he engaged in driving the said vehicle. Merely because he was travelling in a cabin would not make his case different from any other gratuitous passenger.
18. The impugned judgment is founded on misconstruction of Section147. The High Court was wrong in holding that the insurance company shall be liable to indemnify the owner of the vehicle and pay the compensation to the claimant as directed in the award by the Tribunal.
19. The next question that arises for consideration is whether in the peculiar facts of this case a direction could be issued to the insurance company to first satisfy the awarded amount in favour of the claimant and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle (respondent no.2 herein).
20. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Baljit Kaur and others[5],this Court was confronted with a similar situation. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in paragraph
21 of the Report (Pg. 8) held as under : ""21. The upshot of the aforementioned discussions is that instead and in place of the insurer the owner of the vehicle shall be liable to satisfy the decree. The question, however, would be as to whether keeping in view the fact that the law was not clear so long such a direction would be fair and equitable. We do not think so. We, therefore, clarify the legal position which shall have prospective effect. The Tribunal as also the High Court had proceeded in terms of the decision of this Court in Satpal Singh. The said decision has been overruled only in Asha Rani. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the interest of justice will be sub served if the appellant herein is directed to satisfy the awarded amount in favour of the claimant, if not already satisfied, and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle.
For the purpose of such recovery, it would not be necessary for the insurer to file a separate suit but it may initiate a proceeding before the executing court as if the dispute between the insurer and the owner was the subject-matter of determination before the Tribunal and the issue is decided against the owner and in favour of the insurer. We have issued the aforementioned directions having regard to the scope and purport of Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, in terms whereof, it is not only entitled to determine the amount of claim as put forth by the claimant for recovery thereof from the insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly or severally but also the dispute between the insurer on the one hand and the owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident inasmuch as can be resolved by the Tribunal in such a proceeding.
""21. The above position has been followed by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Challa Bharathamma & Ors.[6], wherein this Court in paragraph 13 (Pg. 523) observed as under:
""13. The residual question is what would be the appropriate direction. Considering the beneficial object of the Act, it would be proper for the insurer to satisfy the award, though in law it has no liability. In some cases the insurer has been given the option and liberty to recover the amount from the insured. For the purpose of recovering the amount paid from the owner, the insurer shall not be required to file a suit. It may initiate a proceeding before the executing court concerned as if the dispute between the insurer and the owner was the subject- matter of determination before the Tribunal and the issue is decided against the owner and in favour of the insurer. Before release of the amount to the claimants, owner of the offending vehicle shall furnish security for the entire amount which the insurer will pay to the claimants. The offending vehicle shall be attached, as a part of the security. If necessity arises the executing court shall take assistance of the Regional Transport Authority concerned. The executing court shall pass appropriate orders in accordance with law as to the manner in which the owner of the vehicle shall make payment to the insurer. In case there is any default it shall be open to the executing court to direct realisation by disposal of the securities to be furnished or from any other property or properties of the owner of the vehicle i.e. the insured. In the instant case, considering the quantum involved, we leave it to the discretion of the insurer to decide whether it would take steps for recovery of the amount from the insured.
22. ""In National Insurance Company Limited v. Kaushalaya Devi and Others[7]. In paragraph 15 of the Report (pg. 250), the Court observed as follows: ""15. For the reasons aforementioned, civil appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 10694 is allowed and civil appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 9910 of 2006 is dismissed. If the amount deposited by the Insurance Company has since been withdrawn by the first respondent, it would be open to the Insurance Company to recover the same in the manner specified by the High Court. But if the same has not been withdrawn the deposited amount may be refunded to the Insurance Company and the proceedings for realisation of the amount may be initiated against the owner of the vehicle. In the facts and circumstances of the case, however, there shall be no order as to costs.
23. ""We are informed that by an order dated 19.01.2007 in National Insurance Co. v. Roshan Lal and Another [SLP (C) No. 5699/2006] in light of the argument raised before a two-Judge Bench that the direction ought not to be issued to the insurance company to discharge the liability under the award first and then recover the same from the owner, the matter has been referred to the larger Bench by the following order: ""Having regard to the submissions urged before us, we are of the view that this petition may be placed for consideration before a larger Bench. We notice that in some of the decisions such a direction was made in cases where the compensation had already been paid by the insurer, but there are observations therein which support the view that such a direction can be made in all cases where the owner has insured his vehicle against third party risks. In Baljit Kaur's case (supra) which is a judgment rendered by three Hon'ble Judges, such a direction was made in the special circumstances noticed by the Court in paragraph 21 of the report. There are observations in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Ranjit Saikia and Ors. (2002) 9 SCC 390 which may support the contention of the petitioners before us.
24. ""In National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Parvathneni & Another[SLP(C)CC No. 10993 of 2009], the following two questions have been referred to the larger Bench for consideration: (1) If an Insurance Company can prove that it does not have any liability to pay any amount in law to the claimants under the Motor Vehicles Act or any other enactment, can the Court yet compel it to pay the amount in question giving it liberty to later on recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. (2) Can such a direction be given under Article 142 of the Constitution, and what is the scope of Article 142? Does Article 142 permit the Court to create a liability where there is none?""
25. The pendency of consideration of the above questions by a larger Bench does not mean that the course that was followed in BaljitKaur5 and Challa Bharathamma6 should not be followed, more so in a peculiar fact situation of this case. In the present case, the accident occurred in 1993. At that time, claimant was 28 years' old. He is now about 48 years. The claimant was a driver on heavy vehicle and due to the accident he has been rendered permanently disabled. He has not been able to get compensation so far due to stay order passed by this Court. He cannot be compelled to struggle further for recovery of the amount.
The insurance company has already deposited the entire awarded amount pursuant to the order of this Court passed on 01.08.2011 and the said amount has been invested in a fixed deposit account. Having regard to these peculiar facts of the case in hand, we are satisfied that the claimant (Respondent No. 1) may be allowed to withdraw the amount deposited by the insurance company before this Court along-with accrued interest. The insurance company (appellant) thereafter may recover the amount so paid from the owner (Respondent No. 2 herein). The recovery of the amount by the insurance company from the owner shall be made by following the procedure as laid down by this Court in the case of Challa Bharathamma .
26. Appeal is allowed and disposed of as above with no order as to costs.

1. The short question of law which arises for consideration in this appeal is, whether the manufacture and sale of specified goods that do not physically bear a brand name, from branded sale outlets, would disentitle an assessee from the benefit of S.S.I. Notification No. 1/93-C.E., dated 28th February, 1993, as amended from time to time.
2. Briefly stated, the material facts giving rise to the appeal, are as follows: Pursuant to an inspection by the officials of the enforcement Commissionerate, Chennai-II at the sales outlet of the respondent(hereinafter referred as ""the assessee""), revealed that the assessee was engaged in the manufacture and sale of cookies from branded retail outlets of ""Cookie Man"". The assessee had acquired this brand name from M/s Cookie Man Pvt. Ltd, Australia (which in turn acquired it from M/s Auto- bake Pvt. Ltd., Australia). The brand name used the words ""Cookie Man"" accompanied with a logo depicting the smiling face of a mustachioed chef. The assessee was selling some of these cookies in plastic pouches/containers on which the brand name described above was printed. No brand name was affixed or inscribed on the cookies. Excise duty was duly paid, on the cookies sold in the said pouches/containers. However, on the cookies sold loosely from the counter of the same retail outlet, with plain plates and tissue paper, duty was not paid.
3. The retail outlets did not receive any loose cookies nor did they manufacture them. They received all cookies in sealed pouches/containers. Those sold loosely were taken out of the containers and displayed for sale separately. Even though no separate register was maintained to account for the sale of the cookies sold loosely, their numbers were calculated from the number of empty pouches/containers left behind at the end of day.
4. On scrutiny of the documents recovered from the said outlet and on the basis of the statement of the Executive Director, a notice dated 20th December, 2012 was issued to the assessee by the Commissioner to show cause as to why (i) the cookies sold by the assessee at its outlets be not classified under Chapter sub-heading 1905.11 as biscuits and (ii) in view of their use of brand name ""Cookie Man"" on sale of cookies in plastic pouches/containers, S.S.I. exemption should not be disallowed.
5. Upon consideration of the explanation furnished by the assessee, the Commissioner inter-alia came to the conclusion (relevant for the controversy at hand) that unless the specified goods or the packaging in which these are sold, bear the brand name or the logo, prescribed S.S.I. exemption cannot be denied. Thus, the Commissioner held that since there was neither any material evidence nor averment to prove that the brand name was embossed on the cookies, the assessee was eligible to avail of the benefit of small scale exemption in respect of cookies sold loosely from the counter of the retail outlet. Being aggrieved by the order, both the Department and the assessee filed cross appeals before the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench at Chennai (hereinafter referred to as ""the Tribunal).
6. The decision of the Commissioner having been affirmed by the Tribunal, the revenue is before us in this appeal under Section 35L(b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short ""the Act"").
7. There is no dispute that the specified good is to be classified under sub-heading 1905.11 as Biscuits, manufactured with the aid of power. The controversy revolves around para 4 of S.S.I. notification No. 1/93-C.E. dated 28th February, 1993, which, in its erstwhile form, read as follows: - ""4. The exemption contained in this notification shall not apply to the specified goods where a manufacturer affixes the specified goods with a brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person who is not eligible for the grant of exemption under this notification.
8. ""The meaning of a ""brand name"" or ""trade name"" is enunciated in Explanation IX of the said notification which says: - ""Explanation IX- 'Brand name' or 'trade name' shall mean a brand name or trade name, whether registered or not, that is to say a name or a mark, such as symbol, monogram, label, signature or invented word or writing which is used in relation to such specified goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between such specified goods and some person using such name or mark with or without any indication of the identity of that person.
9. ""Para 4 of the said notification that deals with exemption for certain goods ""affixed"" with a brand name was amended vide notification No. 59/94 - C.E. dated 1st March, 1994, to read:- ""4. The exemption contained in this notification shall not apply to the specified goods, bearing a brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person.
10. ""Part (iii) of para J of the Budget Changes-1994-95 dealt with ""Changes in the SSI schemes"" explains the purpose of the amendment in the following words: ""(iii) Brand name provision has been amended so as to provide that SSI concession shall not apply to the goods bearing the brand name or trade name of another person. The effect of this amendment is that if an SSI unit manufactures the branded goods for another person irrespective of whether the brand name owner himself is SSI unit or not, such goods shall not be eligible for the concession. Another implication of this amendment is that the requirement of affixation or brand name by the SSI unit has been changed and now the only condition is that the goods cleared by SSI unit bearing a brand name of another person shall not be eligible for the concession irrespective of the fact whether the brand name was affixed by the SSI unit or that, the input material used by the SSI unit was already affixed with brand name.
11. ""Mr. N. Venkataraman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee argued that a combined reading of Para 4 and Explanation IX of the notification, along with Para J of the Budget Changes, would lead to the conclusion that only specified goods bearing an affixed brand name, or in other words, those goods that physically display the brand name, are not covered by the exemption. Learned counsel relied on the decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, Jamshedpur Vs. Superex Industries, Bihar[1] for the proposition that a physical manifestation of a brand name on a good is a necessary requirement for disqualification from the exemption granted by the concerned notification.
Learned counsel also relied on the same decision to urge that this Court cannot look into the surrounding circumstances of a good, especially the specific outlet from which it is sold, to construe if it is branded or not; scrutiny, in his opinion, must be limited to the specified good itself. The relevant paragraph of the order on which emphasis was laid, reads as follows: ""3. CEGAT has held that the benefit of the notification would be lost only if the manufacturer affixes the specified goods with a brand name or trade name of the another who is not eligible to the exemption under the notification. It could not be denied that the name Kirloskar is not affixed to the generating sets. CEGAT has held that merely because, in the invoices, the set is passed off as a Kirloskar generating set, the benefit of the notification would not be lost. We see no infirmity in this reasoning. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere.
12. ""We are unable to appreciate as to how a compulsory requirement of physical manifestation of a brand name on the specified good, for it to be construed as a branded good, can be derived from the above passage. The decision in the above case simply recognizes that the benefit would be lost only if a manufacturer affixes the specified goods with a brand or trade name of another who is not eligible for the exemption under the notification. It does not state that the specified good must itself bear or be physically affixed with the brand or trade name. Such an interpretation would lead to absurd results in case of goods, which are incapable of physically bearing brand names.
For instance, the goods, which, due to their very nature and structure, are incapable of bearing brand names, would always be deemed unbranded. Liquids, soft drinks, milk, dairy products, powders, edible products, salt, pepper, sweets, gaseous products, perfumes, deodorants etc., to name a few, are either liquids, gases or amorphous/brittle solids, making it impossible for the good to be affixed with a brand name. In some situations, such an affixation may be impossible, in which case, it would be permissible for the specified good to continue being a branded good, as long as its environment conveys that it is branded.
By environment we mean packaging and wrapping of the good, accessories it is served with, uniform of vendors, invoices, menu cards, hoardings and display boards of outlet, furniture and props used, the specific outlet itself in its entirety and other such factors, all of which together or individually or in parts, may convey that a good is a branded one, notwithstanding that there is no physical inscription of the brand or trade name on the good itself. Further, a specific, dedicated and exclusive outlet from which a good is sold is often the most crucial and conclusive factor to hold a good as branded.
The decision referred to above only made a limited point that invoices alone cannot be the sole basis of construing whether a good is a branded good or not; it does not hold that a specified good itself must be stamped with a brand name. It is therefore, permissible to look into the environment of the good. However, like in the case of Kirloskar generators [Superex Industries (supra)], invoices bearing brand name could not be the sole basis of construing whether goods are branded or not. That decision would depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. There can be no precise formula for such a determination; in some cases certain factors may carry more weight than in other situations. However, in most circumstances, an exclusive branded outlet from which the good is sold, would be a crucial factor in determining the question.
13. Learned counsel strongly relied on another decision of this Court in Kohinoor Elastics (P) Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Indore[2], for the proposition that only the ""specified good"" in question must be scrutinized and the expression cannot be expanded to mean ""specified outlets"" or other surrounding circumstances. To bring home his point, reliance was placed on the following paragraphs from the said decision:
""5. Clause 4 of the notification is unambiguous and clear. It specifically states that the exemption contained in the notification shall not apply to specific goods which bear a brand name or trade name (registered or not) of another person. It is settled law that to claim exemption under a notification one must strictly comply with the terms of the notification. It is not permissible to imply words into the notification which the legislature has purposely not used. The framers were aware that use of a brand/trade name is generally to show to a consumer a connection between the goods and a person. The framers were aware that goods may be manufactured on order for captive consumption by that customer and bear the brand/trade name of that customer. The framers were aware that such goods may not reach the market in the form in which they were supplied to the customer.
The framers were aware that the customer may merely use such goods as an input for the goods manufactured by him. Yet clause 4 provides in categoric terms that the exemption is lost if the goods bear the brand/trade name of another. Clause 4 does not state that the exemption is lost only in respect of such goods as reach the market. It does not carve out an exception for goods manufactured for captive consumption. The framers meant what they provided. The exemption was to be available only to goods which did not bear a brand/trade name of another. The reason for this is obvious. If use of brand/trade names were to be permitted on goods manufactured as per the orders of customers or which are to be captively consumed then manufacturers, who are otherwise not entitled to exemption, would get their goods or some inputs manufactured on job-work basis or through some small party, freely use their brand/trade name on the goods and avail of the exemption.
It is to foreclose such a thing that clause 4 provides, in unambiguous terms, that the exemption is lost if the ""goods"" bear a brand/trade name of another."" xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx ""7. Now in this case there is no dispute on facts. The ""course of trade"" of the appellants is making elastics for specified customers. It is an admitted position that the appellants are affixing the brand/trade name of their customers on the elastics. They are being so affixed because the appellants and/or the customer wants to indicate that the ""goods (elastic)"" have a connection with that customer. This is clear from the fact that the elastics on which brand/trade name of 'A' is affixed will not and cannot be used by any person other than the person using that brand/trade name.
As set out hereinabove once a brand/trade name is used in the course of trade of the manufacturer, who is indicating a connection between the ""goods"" manufactured by him and the person using the brand/trade name, the exemption is lost. In any case it cannot be forgotten that the customer wants his brand/trade name affixed on the product not for his own knowledge or interest. The elastic supplied by the appellants is becoming part and parcel of the undergarment. The customer is getting the brand/trade name affixed because he wants the ultimate customer to know that there is a connection between the product and him.
14. ""We feel that to hold from the above passages that every good must be physically stamped with a brand or trade name to be considered a branded good in terms of the notification, and that, one is forbidden to look beyond the specified good into the surrounding environment of the good in construing if it is a branded good or not, would be a complete misunderstanding of the above judgment and a distortion of the concept of a brand or trade name. The above judgment makes no such observation and was delivered on a completely different set of facts and circumstances.
It involved a case of undergarments manufactured by a producer P2, which used branded elastics produced by P1, and retained the brand name of P1 in the final product. P2 was denied exemption under the same notification involved in the present case because of the appearance of brand name of another i.e. P1, not covered by the same notice. P2 argued that the presence of P1's brand name should not be taken as a basis for disqualification from the benefits of the exemption since the customer buying the good would continue to associate the good with P2 and not P1, thus making it a branded good of only P2. This Court rejected the contention and held that P1 is providing a stamped input for captive consumption to P2 ""because he wants the ultimate customer to know that there is a connection between the product and him"".
The Court further observed that the term ""specified goods"" is used without any caveats and hence rejected the contention that some consideration should be given to the fact that P1 was used only as an input in the making of the final product of P2. It is in this background that this Court observed that the requirement of the notifications must be adhered to strictly and cannot be diluted by substituting the term ""specified goods"" with the nature of goods or the manner of disposal. In case the specified good clearly exhibits a brand name of another not covered by the notification, it would squarely fall within the confines of Para 4 of the notification; looking beyond the specified good to consider whether it is an input or not is not necessary in case of a conspicuous brand name.
However, to apply this principle to the scenario of a specified good that does not contain a brand name at all would be equivalent to fitting a square peg in a round hole. If a final product is marked or stamped with a brand name, it is clearly a branded good; to stretch this principle to imply that one not marked by any brand is an unbranded good, is untenable. In case a scrutiny of the good itself fails to reveal a brand name then the search must not end there; one ought to look into the surrounding circumstances of the good to decipher, if it is in fact branded or not.
15. We are of the opinion that such an approach is necessary to maintain the essence of the concept of a brand name. A brand/ trade name must not be reduced to a label or sticker that is affixed on a good. The test of whether the good is branded or unbranded, must not be the physical presence of the brand name on the good, but whether it, as Explanation IX reads, ""is used in relation to such specified goods for the purpose of indicating, or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between such specified goods and some person using such name or mark with or without any indication of the identity of the person."" Therefore, whether the brand name appears in entirety or in parts or does not appear at all cannot be the chief criterion; primary focus has to be on whether an indication of a connection is conveyed in the course of trade between such specified goods and some person using the mark. Highlighting this principle, this Court in Commissioner of Central Excise, Trichy Vs. Rukmani Pakkwell Traders[3] observed thus: -
""6. The Tribunal had also held that under the notification the use must be of ""such brand name"". The Tribunal has held that the words ""such brand name"" show that the very same brand name or trade name must be used. The Tribunal has held that if there are any differences then the exemption would not be lost. We are afraid that in coming to this conclusion the Tribunal has ignored Explanation IX. Explanation IX makes it clear that the brand name or trade name shall mean a brand name or trade name (whether registered or not), that is to say, a name or a mark, code number, design number, drawing number, symbol, monogram, label, signature or invented word or writing. This makes it very clear that even a use of part of a brand name or trade name, so long as it indicates a connection in the course of trade would be sufficient to disentitle the person from getting exemption under the notification. In this case, admittedly, the brand name or trade name is the word ""ARR"" with the photograph of the founder of the group. Merely because the registered trade mark is not entirely reproduced does not take the respondents out of clause 4 and make them eligible to the benefit of the notification.
16. ""16. Similarly, in Commissioner of Central Excise, Chandigarh-I, Vs. Mahaan Dairies[4], it was noted as follows:
""6. We have today delivered a judgment in CCE v. Rukmani Pakkwell Traders, (2004) 11 SCC 801 wherein we have held in respect of another notification containing identical words that it makes no difference whether the goods on which the trade name or mark is used are the same in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Even if the goods are different, so long as the trade name or brand name of some other company is used the benefit of the notification would not be available. Further, in our view, once a trade name or brand name is used then mere use of additional words would not enable the party to claim the benefit of the notification."" ""8. It is settled law that in order to claim benefit of a notification, a party must strictly comply with the terms of the notification. If on wording of the notification the benefit is not available then by stretching the words of the notification or by adding words to the notification benefit cannot be conferred. The Tribunal has based its decision on a decision delivered by it in Rukmani Pakkwell Traders v. CCE (1999) 109 ELT 204 (CEGAT). We have already overruled the decision in that case. In this case also we hold that the decision of the Tribunal is unsustainable. It is accordingly set aside.
17. ""As aforesaid, once it is established that a specified good is a branded good, whether it is sold without any trade name on it, or by another manufacturer, it does not cease to be a branded good of the first manufacturer. Therefore, soft drinks of a certain company do not cease to be manufactured branded goods of that company simply because they are served in plain glasses, without any indication of the company, in a private restaurant. The good will continue to be a branded good of the company that manufactured it. The same principle would apply in the case of potato chips, chocolates, biscuits, wafers, powders and other such goods often sold from various locations.
18. In case of goods sold from exclusive single brand retail outlets or restaurants or stores, the fact that a good is sold from such a store ought to be a relevant fact in construing if the good is its branded good or not. In the case of such goods, perhaps a rebuttable presumption arises in favour of such goods being branded goods of the specified store. Such a presumption can be rebutted if it is shown that the specified good being sold is in fact a branded good of another manufacturer. Thus, branded potato chips, soft drinks, chocolates etc. though sold from such outlets, will not be considered to be goods of such outlets. However, all other goods, sold without any appearance of a brand or trade name on them, would not be deemed unbranded goods; to the contrary, they may be deemed to be branded goods of that outlet unless a different brand or trade name appears.
19. Hence, we hold that it is not necessary for goods to be stamped with a trade or brand name to be considered as branded goods under the SSI notification, discussed above. A scrutiny of the surrounding circumstances is not only permissible, but necessary to decipher the same; the most important of these factors being the specific outlet from which the good is sold. However, such factors would carry different hues in different scenarios. There can be no single formula to determine if a good is branded or not; such determination would vary from case to case. Also, our observations must be limited to this notification and not supplanted to other laws with similar subject matter pertaining to trade names and brand names.
20. Applying the said principles on the facts at hand, we fail to see how the same branded cookies, sold in containers, can transform to become unbranded ones, when sold from the same counter, or even from an adjoining counter, without packaging carrying the brand name. Admittedly, on the same cookies, physically bearing brand ""Cookie Man"" sold in containers carrying brand name duty is paid. It is interesting to note that learned counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee first argued that to determine if the cookies sold from the counter are branded or not, scrutiny must be limited to the case of the cookies themselves without looking at the surrounding circumstances; yet went on to argue that the tissues and plates they were served on did not bear the brand of the specified good. Either the environment of the goods can be looked into, or cannot be taken into consideration at all. Once it is established, as in the instant case, that the environment of the goods can be gone into to construe if it is branded or not, we do not see why the environment of the goods should be limited to the plates and tissues, on which they are served.
As aforesaid, in the instant case, the cookies were sold from a dedicated outlet of ""Cookie Man"" where no other products but those of the assessee were sold. The invoices carry the name of the company and the cookies were sold from a counter of the store. In our opinion, the store's decision to sell some cookies without containers that are stamped with its brand or trade name does not change the brand of the cookies. We are convinced that the cookies sold even without inscription of the brand name, indicate a clear connection with the brand name, in the course of assessee's business of manufacture and sale of cookies under the brand name ""Cookie Man"". They continue to be branded cookies of ""Cookie Man"" and hence cannot claim exemption under the SSI Notification.
21. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the opinion that the impugned decision of the Tribunal is erroneous and unsustainable. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

2. Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that this matter is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Union of India Vs. Arun Jyoti Kundu and Ors. (2007) 7 SCC 472. In the present case, the Calcutta High Court vide its judgment dated 4.3.2003 passed in WPCT No.1325 of 2002, has dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant. Relying upon the aforementioned judgment of the High Court rendered in WPCT No.1325 of 2002, the judgment of the Tribunal dated 7.1.2003 passed in O.A No.1419 of 1997 has been affirmed.
3. This Court by its judgment in the case of Union of India Vs. Arun Jyoti Kundu and Ors. (supra), has set aside the judgment of the High Court and that of the Central Administrative Tribunal and dismissed the O.A. filed before the Central Administrative Tribunal. In paragraph 19 of the judgment this Court has held as under:
""19. We are afraid that the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the direction, it has issued. The fact that notwithstanding the Fifth Pay Commission not recommending, particularly, the payment of higher scale to two sets of typists, typists in English language and typists in Hindi language, the Government chose to give them relief with effect from 31.1.2000 would not justify an inference of discrimination or a finding that the authority has acted arbitrarily or unreasonably.
As this Court has clarified in the decisions adverted to, it is for the Government to act on the report of the Pay Commission or either to accept or not to accept its recommendation. Once the recommendations of the pay commission are accepted, in full, it could also give effect to it from the date recommended in that behalf. But when admittedly no provision was made in respect of the English and Hindi typists and they pointed to the anomalies and the Government on the basis of the recommendation of the Anomalies Committees decided to give them the scale with effect from 31.1.2000, it could not be held to be discriminatory or to be beyond the power of the Government.
4. Ultimately, this Court held that the Central Administrative Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the directions, it has issued and the High Court was in error in not setting them aside and accordingly, the original applications filed before the Central Administrative Tribunal were dismissed.
5. In view of the aforesaid observations of this Court, this appeal has to be allowed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the High Court in W.P.C.T. No.625/2003 on 9th September, 2003 is set aside. No costs.",0

Heard learned counsel on either side. We are in these cases concerned with the interpretation of Section173-A of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act 1959, as amended by the Rajasthan Municipalities Amendment Act 1999 (Act No.19 of 1999), which deals with the power of the State Government to allow change in use of land on payment of conversion charges. The Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, following the judgment of this Court in State of Rajasthan and others v. Pareshar Soni (2007) 14SCC 144, disposed of all the appeals, holding that the Municipal Corporation is not empowered to demand any amount for change of use of the land.
We may refer to the facts in Civil Appeal No.240 of 2013 @ SLP(C)11907 of 2009 for disposal of all these appeals, since common questions arise for consideration in all these appeals. Respondents herein purchased a plot of land, with a house, on9.9.2002, situated in a residential area by way of a registered sale deed. Later, an application under the Rajasthan Municipalities (Change of Land Use) Rules, 2000 (for short '2000 Rules"") was preferred for conversion of land use from residential to commercial. They also deposited self-assessment amount of Rs.10,500/- for the said purpose.
Municipal Corporation, while considering the said application gave a public notice on22.7.2003 inviting objections, if any, under Rule 4(1) of the 2000 Rules. The Land Use Change Committee of the Corporation, on 23.2.2004, approved the request for conversion of land use. Municipal Corporation then demanded an amount of Rs.5,70,300/- as land use conversion charges in accordance with the 2000 Rules read with Section 173-A, as amended. Respondents herein filed a Writ Petition No.1844 of 2004 challenging the vires of amended Section 173-A of the Act and to quash the demand notice dated 2.4.2004.
In the meanwhile another Writ Petition No.879 of2003 was also filed by one Mewa Ram challenging the vires of the amended Section 173-A. The Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court vide its judgment in Mewa Ram v. State of Rajasthan reported in 2007 (1) WLC (Raj)1, was pleased to upheld the vires of Section 173-A as inserted by Act No.19 of 1999. Following that judgment, the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, on 28.11.2007, remanded the matter to the learned single Judgeto decide whether the writ petition be entertained or not. The case was later registered as D.B.C. Writ Petition No.430 of 2008.
The learned Single Judge, however, placing reliance on the judgment in Pareshar Soni's case (supra) allowed the writ petition and the notice dated 2.4.2004 was quashed, though it was contended by the Corporation that the applicability of Section 173-A (evidently as amended) was neither argued nor considered by this Court in Pareshar Soni case. The Municipal Corporation then took the matter in appeal before the Division Bench in DB Civil Special Appeal No.159 of 2009. The court dismissed the appeal holding that the issue raised stood covered by the judgment in Pareshar Soni's case (supra). Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned Additional Advocate General, appearing for the State of Rajasthan submitted that the High court has committed an error in taking the view that the issue raised stood covered by the judgment of this Court in Pareshar Soni's case (supra).
Learned counsel pointed out that this Court was dealing with the un-amended Section 173-Aof the Act in that case, but, so far as the present appeals are concerned, applications have to be considered by the amended Section 173-A read with2000 Rules. Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel appearing for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that there is no illegality in the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan warranting interference by this Court. Learned counsel submitted, in any view of the matter, the land in question falls in a commercial area as per the latest approved Master Plan and hence there is no question of paying any conversion charges.
We are, in these cases, concerned with the question whether the judgment of this Court in Pareshar Soni's case (supra) would apply to the demand notices issued by the Municipal Corporation on the basis of Section173-A, as amended by Act No. 19 of 1999. We may, at the very outset, point out that this Court in Pareshar Soni's case (supra) was dealing with the un-amended Section 173-A of the Act. For a proper consideration of the question raised, it would be profitable to refer to the un-amended Section 173-A as well as the amended Section 173-A of the Act. Section 173-A of the Act, prior to its amendment, reads as follows: ""173-A (Power of the State Government to allow change in the use of land)
1. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where any land has been allotted or sold to any person by a municipality or the State Government subject to the condition of restraining its use for a particular purpose, the State Government may, if it is satisfied so to do in public interest, allow the owner or holder of such land to use it for any other purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally allotted or sold, on payment of such conversion charges as may be prescribed. Provided that the rates of conversion charges may be different for different areas and for different purposes.
2. The conversion charges so realized shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund of the State or to the fund of the Municipality as may be determined by the State Government.
3. Such charges shall be the first charge on the interest of the person liable in the land the use of which has been changed and shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue."" Section 173-A of the Act as amended by the Amending Act No. 19 of 1999 reads as follows:
""Section 173-A - Restriction on change of use of land and power of the State Government to allow change of use of land:
1. No person shall use or permit the use of any land situated in any municipal area, for the purpose other than that for which such land was originally allotted or sold to any person by the State Government, any municipality, and other local authority or any other body of authority in accordance with any law for the time being in force or, otherwise than as specified under a Master Plan, wherever it is in operation.
2. In the case of any land not allotted or sold as aforesaid and not covered under sub-section (1), no person shall use or permit the use of any such land situated in a municipal, area for the purpose other than that for which such land-use was or is permissible, in accordance with the Master Plan, wherever it is in operation, or under any law for the time being in force.
3. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) of sub- section (2), the State Government or any authority authorized by it by notification in the Official Gazette, may allow the owner or holder of any such land to have change of use thereof, if it is satisfied so to do in public interest, on payment of conversion charges at such rates and in such manner as may be prescribed with respect to the following changes in use:-
i. From residential to commercial or any other purpose; or
ii. From commercial to any other purpose; or
iii. From industrial to commercial or any other purpose; or
iv. From cinema to commercial or any other purpose;
Provided that rates of conversion charges may be different for different areas and for different purpose.
4. Any person who has already changed the use of land in violation of the provisions of this Act in force at the time of change of use, shall apply to the State Government or any authority authorized by it under sub-section (3), within six months from the date of commencement of the Rajasthan Municipalities (Amendment) Act, 1999 (Act No.19 of 1999) for regularization of said use and upon regularization of the change of use of land he shall deposit the amount contemplated under sub-section (3).
5. Where the State Government or the authority authorized by it under sub-section (3) is satisfied that a person who ought to have applied for permission or regularisation under this Section, has not applied and that such permission can be granted or the use of land can be regularized, it may proceed to determine the conversion charges after due notice and hearing the party/parties and the charges so determined shall become due to the municipality and be recoverable under sub-section (7).
6. The conversion charges so realized shall be credited to the fund of the municipality.
7. Charges under section shall be the first charge on the interest of the person liable to pay such charges with respect to the land, the use of which has been changed and shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue."" On a bare reading of un-amended Section 173-A(1) of the Act would indicate that the conversion for change of Land Use charges could only be realized if the land was allotted by the Municipality or the State Government and there was a condition for restraining use for a particular purpose only.
Therefore, in the absence of land being allotted by the State Government/Municipality and in absence of any specific stipulation regarding use of land, the conversion charges could not be claimed. This was the ratio laid down in Pareshar Soni's case (supra) interpreting the un-amended Section 173-A of the Act. The Legislature, with a view to ensure planned and regulated development of the urban area felt it necessary to charge for the change of use in certain circumstances of those lands which were not sold or allotted by municipality or by the State Government. Further it is also felt that such a change of user be permitted only ""in public interest"".
In this connection, we may refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Amendment Act, 1999, which reads as under: ""Statement of Objects and Reasons: The existing provisions contained in Section 173-A of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act, 1959 provide that where any land has been allotted or sold subject to the condition of restraining its use for a particular purpose, to any person by a Municipality or the State Government, the State Government may, if it is satisfied so to do in public interest, allow the owner or holder of the land, to use it for any other purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally allotted or sold, on payment of such conversion charge as may be prescribed.
With a view to ensure planned and regulated development of the urban areas it is necessary to restrict and bar the change of use in certain circumstances of those lands also which were not sold or allotted by Municipality or the State Government. However, the power of the State Government or any other authority authorized by it, to allow change of use of land, on payment of conversion charges is sought to be retained. With a view to achieve the aforesaid objective, the existing section 173-A of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act, 1959 is proposed to be substituted.
""Amended Section 173-A not only restricts the change of use of land, as the same has been allotted by the municipality or the State Government, but also put restrictions if the land has been allotted by any other local authority. Section 173-A(2) covers the cases which are not even covered by Section 173-A(1) and brings in its fold even the change of use of land which is not in consonance with the Master Plan. Further Section 173-A(1)(2) and (3) also contemplates a situation wherein the State Government is entitled to levy conversion charges if the change in use from one purpose to other purpose. Amendment was necessitated since the State Legislature thought the provision of Section 173-A (un-amended) stood as an impediment for proper planning of urban areas.
In other words, with a view to ensure planned and regulated development of urban areas, it was felt that some restrictions have to be imposed and it was for that purpose that Section173-A was amended. We may, in this respect, also indicate that, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 297 read with Section 173-A of the 1959 Act, 2000Rules were promulgated. It is under the above-mentioned Rules that the respondents filed an application on 16.7.2003 for change of land use from residential to commercial. Following those Rules, the Corporation issued public notice inviting objections. Later, the Land Use Committee met and approved the conversion for which a demand notice of Rs.5,70,300/- was raised by the Corporation on 2.4.2004.
We are of the view that the demand is legal and valid and in accordance with the provisions of Section173-A, as inserted by Amendment Act 19 of 1999 read with 2000 Rules. Weare also of the view that the Rajasthan High Court has committed an error in applying the Judgment of this Court in Pareshar Soni's case (supra) which was dealing with the un-amended provision of Section 173-A. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents, however, submitted that the area in question is notified as commercial area under the Master Plan and, therefore, there is no question of any conversion of the residential property to commercial. We notice that this point was not raised before the High Court and we are, therefore, not called upon to decide that question. However, the respondents, if so advised, may take up this issue before the Corporation and it is for the Corporation to consider that issue in accordance with law. Appeals are accordingly allowed and the judgments of the High Court are set aside. However, there will be no order as to costs.

"1.	Leave granted.
2.	Respondent nos.2 to 6 are not served. However, learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1 would submit that the un-served respondents are not necessary parties for the purpose of disposal of this appeal.
3.	Respondent No. 1 is a student studying in an Engineering college. Since numbers of seats were lying vacant in various disciplines of the engineering faculty in the colleges run by the appellant-University, the respondent had approached the Writ Court for appropriate directions. The Writ Court, without taking into account the various Government Orders on the subject prevailing as on that date, proceeded to issue direction to the appellant-University in favour of the Respondent No. 1 to allot an Engineering seat to him.
4.	We have heard learned counsel for the parties to the lis and also carefully perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. Learned counsel appearing for the University has also brought to our notice the various Government Orders and Circulars issued, from time to time by the State Government which would govern the admissions to the appellant-colleges. We are of the considered view that the High Court before issuing a positive direction to the appellant-University to admit respondent no.1, ought to have taken into account the respective various Government Orders and the Circulars prevailing as on that date, insofar as admissions to the professional colleges are concerned. Since that has not been done, we cannot sustain the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. Accordingly, we allow this appeal and set aside the judgment and order dated 18.09.2012 passed by the High Court.
Ordered accordingly. No order as to costs.

2.	This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at Goa in Contempt Appeal No.1 of 2006, dated 24.08.2007. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant and confirmed the order passed by the learned Single Judge of High Court in Criminal Writ Petition No. 1 of 2006, dated 17.07.2006, wherein certain observations were made while discharging the contempt notice issued to the appellant.
3.	The appellant before us is the District and Sessions Judge, North Goa at Panaji-Goa. For certain acts and omissions said to have been committed by her, the learned Single Judge of the High Court had initiated proceedings for civil contempt by issuing notice dated 15.06.2006. Vide order dated 17.07.2006, the learned Single Judge had discharged the contempt proceedings and directed the Registrar General of the High Court to initiate appropriate disciplinary proceedings against the appellant.
4.	The aforesaid direction was issued after discharge of the contempt proceedings. The same was questioned by the appellant before the Division Bench of the High Court in Contempt Appeal No.1 of 2006. The Division Bench by impugned judgment and order concurred with the observations made by the learned Single Judge and further clarified that the said directions issued imply that the Registrar General of the High Court must seek appropriate directions from the competent authority in respect of any disciplinary proceedings required to be initiated against the appellant and that the order did not disclose any aspect regarding finality of disciplinary proceedings.
5.	We have heard the learned counsel for the parties to the lis at length.
6.	The observations so made by the Court in the course of its judgment and order, in our considered view would cast a shadow on the judicial career of the appellant, which, in our opinion, should not be jeopardized especially at this crucial juncture of her professional development as a judicial officer. The career of a bright judicial officer must not, therefore, be imperiled such that her further growth is stunted. Therefore, without going into the details and finer aspects of the case at hand, we intend to set aside certain observations made by the High Court which would affect the career of the appellant.
7.	Accordingly, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order in Contempt Appeal No. 1 of 2006 dated 24.08.2007 and the impugned judgment and order in Criminal Writ Petition No. 1 of 2006 dated 17.07.2006 and the communication of the Registrar General of the High Court dated 20.10.2008. We clarify that we have not disturbed the order passed by the High Court discharging the contempt proceedings initiated against the appellant Ordered accordingly. W.P.(C)No.53/2009: In view of the foregoing order passed in the Civil Appeal@ Special Leave Petition (C) No. 4100 of 2009, this Writ Petition is also disposed of. We further direct that the remarks contained in the letter dated 20.10.2008 stands deleted and the related Annual Confidential Reports be amended accordingly.
Ordered accordingly.

2. The disputes between the parties relate to lands measuring 37 Kanals 5 marl as comprised in several survey numbers forming the subject matter of OWP No. 480 of 2003 and OWP No. 454 of 2005. On 21st November, 1980, the Custodian of Evacuee Property, Kashmir, issued a Notification under Section6 of the Jammu and Kashmir State Evacuees' (Administration of Property)Act, 2006, hereinafter referred to as ""the 2006 Act"", declaring the aforesaid land to be evacuee property, being in the ownership of one Qamar-ud-Din and other evacuees. Inasmuch as, the writ petitioners in OWP No.480 of 2003, claiming to the tenants-at-will of the land involved in the writ petition, commenced earth filling, they were stopped from doing so by the Evacuee Department. It is the case of the writ petitioners that when they made inquiries, they were able to lay their hands on records indicating that the lands measuring 11 kanals 6 marlas out of the land comprised in the said survey numbers had been taken over by the Evacuee Department and placed at the supurdnama of the Custodian vide three seizure memos dated 22nd January, 2003 and 1st February, 2003. Claiming that they were in possession of the land in the capacity of tenants-at-will since before the aforesaid Act came to be enacted, the petitioner in OWP No. 480of 2003 prayed for the following reliefs:-
i. ""it be declared that Section 6 of the J & K Evacuee (Administration of Property) Act, 2006 is unconstitutional;
ii. it be declared that Section 3 of the Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976 in so far as it excludes the application of Sections 4 and 8 of the tenants of evacuee land is ultra vires the Constitution.
iii. That by an appropriate writ, direction or order including the writ in the nature of certiorari following notification/communication be quashed:-
1. Notification dated 21.11.1980
2. Communication No. CEPS/GE/2002/2766-70 dated 17.12.2002.
3. Communication No.CG(EP)1020/ 2003/ 167-Misc. K dated 23.1.2003
4. Three seizure memo dated 2.2.2003
5. Communication No. CEPE-JE/2002/3347-50 dated 6.2.2003
6. Communication No. DFI/SG/378 dated 22.2.2003
iv. That by an appropriate writ, direction or order including a writ in the nature of prohibition respondents be restrained from interfering in the rights of possession of the petitioners in the land and in their levelling of land and from fencing.
v. "" Along with the writ petition, the petitioners also filed a miscellaneous petition seeking interim relief in which it was ordered that the Respondents were not to dispossess the petitioners from the lands in dispute, till the next date. The petitioners were also restrained from raising any construction or changing the nature and character of the said lands during the said period.
However, when during the pendency of the writ petition, the Custodian started construction of a shopping complex, in violation of the said order of injunction, the petitioners filed another CMP in which notice was issued on 22nd April, 2004, returnable within four weeks, and till then the parties were directed to maintain status quo. Subsequently, by an order dated 30th September, 2004, the Registrar(Judicial) of the High Court was appointed as Commissioner to visit and submit a report which he did on 7th October, 2004.
3. On receipt of the report and on being satisfied that construction work had been undertaken by the Custodian on the aforesaid lands and was being proceeded with, the High Court by its order dated 19th November,2004, restrained the Respondents from raising any construction on the spot. Since its earlier orders had been violated by the Custodian, the Station House Officer of the concerned Police Station was directed to see that the order of the Court was duly complied with, till the petition was considered for admission, or until further orders.
4. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the learned Civil Judge, the Custodian of Evacuee Property filed LPA No. 169 of 2004. Other writ petitioners, who also claimed to be in possession of their lands as tenants-at-will and as ""protected tenants"", have also challenged the validity of the provisions of Section 6 of the Jammu and Kashmir Evacuee(Administration of Property) Act, 2006 and Section 3 of the Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976, insofar as it excludes the application of Sections 4 and8 to the tenants of evacuee properties.
5. While the matters were pending, serious efforts were made by the parties for an out of court settlement which ultimately fructified in terms of a settlement which was submitted before the Court by way of CMP No. 128of 2006. The Settlement presented before the Court was duly signed by the Custodian of Evacuee Property, Kashmir and by all the writ petitioners and their counsel. While the above miscellaneous petition was pending consideration, the Advocate General filed an application on 23rd May, 2006,praying that the Settlement be not accepted, which application was later withdrawn.
In the meantime, there was a change in the Government and the Custodian was also transferred. The new Custodian took a decision to refer the matter back to the State Government. On 10th October, 2006, the Custodian filed an application praying for withdrawal of the Settlement contained in CMP No. 128 of 2006, and in support of such application, the Custodian placed reliance upon a letter of the Revenue Department in which it was stated that the Revenue Minister had accorded approval for reversing the earlier decision taken on 27/28th March, 2005, for entering into a settlement with the occupants of the evacuee property. The said application for withdrawal of the Settlement filed by the Custodian came to be registered as CMP No. 525 of 2006.
6. The two miscellaneous petitions, being CMP No. 128 of 2006, filed by the parties for disposing of the appeal and writ petitions in terms of the compromise and CMP No. 525 of 2006, filed by the Custodian for withdrawal of the Settlement, came up for consideration before the Division Bench of the Hon'ble Mr. Justice H. Imtiaz Hussain and the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir, on 15th September, 2007. As indicated hereinbefore, the Hon'ble Judges differed on the relief prayed for. While H. Imtiaz Hussain,J. held that the Settlement violated Rule 13-C of the Jammu and Kashmir State Evacuees' (Administration of Property) Rules, 2008, hereinafter referred to as ""the 2008 Rules"" and could not, therefore, be accepted by the Court, Mansoor Ahmad Mir J. held that the aforesaid Rule did not apply to the facts of the case and that it was nobody's case, that the Settlement arrived at was the outcome of fraud or unlawful.
His Lordship was also of the view that the Settlement having been duly signed and acted upon by the parties, the same was binding on the parties and could not be withdrawn unilaterally. His Lordship, therefore, dismissed CMP No. 525 of 2006, filed by the Custodian for withdrawal of the Settlement and directed the listing of LPA No. 169 of 2004 and CMP No. 128 of 2006, for further arguments. In view of such differences, the matter was referred to Hon'ble the Chief Justice in terms of Rule 36(2) of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Rules, for referring the matter to a Third Judge. The learned third Judge framed three questions for consideration, namely, .
a. whether Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules is attracted to the Settlement arrived at by the parties?.
b. whether the Settlement contravenes Rule 13-C?
c. whether the Custodian can withdraw from the Settlement unilaterally?
7. Before the learned third Judge it was sought to be urged on behalf of the State that the chunk of the land in question belonged to one Qamar-ud-Din who had two brothers, namely, Ahmad Din and Imam Din. In the disturbances of 1947, Qamar-ud-Din left the State and became an evacuee and his property was declared as evacuee property. In 1949 or 1950 there was no such record available in the Custodians Department. Subsequently, Ahmad Din submitted three applications dated 11th Assuj 2009, before the Custodian of Evacuee properties with a request that three bungalows along with the premises be declared as non-evacuee property as the entire property was held by the three brothers, Qamar-ud-Din, Ahmad Din and Imam Din. The said three applications were dismissed on grounds of default on 28th July, 1956.An application for review of the said order was filed on 20th November,1956, which was disposed of by the Custodian by his Order dated 5thSeptember, 1963, whereby the close relatives of the evacuees were appointed as managers of the properties provided they gave an undertaking that they would submit yearly accounts of income and expenditure to the Department and deposit the income from the properties regularly so that the same could be credited against the names of the evacuees.
It was, therefore, contended on behalf of the State that in terms of the above Orders, the property came under the control of the Evacuee Department and was being administered through its allottees and managers appointed by it. It was also the stand of the State that once the Custodian came into control of the evacuee properties, he decided to construct a Shopping Mall over the land and allotted the work of construction to a contractor, who started raising the construction thereupon. It was also urged that notwithstanding the claim of the writ petitioners to be in possession of the lands as tenants, their rights, if any, in the land, were extinguished once the Evacuee Property Act came into effect and in any case by virtue of the declaration issued under Section 6 of the 2006 Act.
8. It was also the case of the State that any allotment of lands belonging to the State could not have been settled without complying with the provisions of Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules and such contravention invalidated the Settlement which was, therefore, illegal and was rightly declared to be so by H. Imtiaz Hussain, J. On the other hand, it was contended by Mr. Shah, appearing for the writ petitioners, that the Settlement between the parties was in the nature of a contract and had been arrived at by the parties who enjoyed the freedom to contract. It was also submitted by him that Rule 13-C could have applied if the land to be allotted was vacant. According to Mr. Shah, since the writ petitioners were holding the land as tenants, it was not vacant for the purposes of Rule 13-C of the Rules. According to Mr. Shah, the views expressed by the Hon'ble Justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir was in consonance with Rule 13-C, which in the facts of the case, could not have any application to the lands in question.
9. It was also contended by Mr. Shah that even assuming that Rule 13-Cwas applicable, even then there was no violation of its provisions as the premium was fixed in the present case by taking into consideration the fact that the writ petitioners were surrendering all their rights in respect of the whole land. The premium was fixed by the members of a committee headed by none else than the Minister-in-Charge of the Custodian Department. Mr. Shah also submitted before the learned third Judge that the rate of Rs.30lakhs per kanal, as indicated by the Appellants, was not based on any relevant material.
10. As mentioned hereinbefore, the controversy in this case related to the applicability of Rule 13-C in regard to the land in question. In his judgment and order dated 25th March, 2008, the learned third Judge, Y.P. Nargotra. J. agreed with the view taken by H. Imtiaz Hussain, J. that the parties had violated Rule 13-C of the above-mentioned Rules and the Custodian was, therefore, competent to unilaterally withdraw the same. The Learned Judge came to such a conclusion on the ground that in terms of the Settlement arrived at, the writ petitioners would have to surrender all their rights over the entire land, which would render the land vacant within the meaning of Rule 13-C.
11. On the question as to whether the Settlement contravened Rule 13-C,the learned third Judge was of the view that the premium to be paid for the lease to be granted to the respondents/writ petitioners under the Settlement had not been determined by putting the lease to an open auction which was in contravention of the mandatory requirement of Rule 13-C. The learned Judge, therefore, held that the Settlement contravened Rule 13-C on the point of determining the premium payable.
12. On the third question as to whether the Custodian could withdraw from the Settlement unilaterally, the learned third Judge held that Rule 3 of Order 23 CPC, which related to compromise of suits, would have application provided it was proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the suit had been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise. In such case, the Court would have the discretion to order such agreement or compromise to be recorded and shall pass a decree in accordance there within so far as it related to the parties to the suit. The learned third Judge took note of the Explanation to Rule 3 of Order 23 CPC, which provides that an agreement or compromise which is void or voidable under the Contract Act shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of the Rule. Accordingly, in terms of the above Explanation, an agreement not found to be lawful, could be rejected by the Court for the purpose of passing a decree.
The learned third Judge then referred to Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872, whereby any agreement which the Court regards as immoral or opposed to public policy, is void. The learned third Judge held that the Settlement was directly hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act as it defeated the object of Rule 13-C and was, therefore, unlawful for the purposes of Rule 3 of Order 23 CPC. The Learned Third Judge held that the Settlement being unlawful, the Custodian was entitled to withdraw from the Settlement unilaterally. Agreeing with the views expressed by H. Imtiaz Hussain, J., the learned third Judge observed that by consent or agreement, the parties cannot achieve what is contrary to law and that the Settlement arrived at between the parties could not be accepted.
13. As a result of the above, while the two miscellaneous petitions were disposed of by the High Court, LPA No. 169 of 2004 and OWP No. 480 of 2003,filed by the Appellants challenging the Notification dated 21st November,1980, are still pending decision in the High Court.
14. These two Appeals arise from the final judgment and order dated 25thMarch, 2008, passed by the learned third Judge of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court at Srinagar, in the said miscellaneous applications.
15. Briefly stated, the grievance of the Appellants is directed against the order passed by H. Imtiaz Hussain, J., holding that the Settlement violated Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules and could not, therefore, be accepted by the Court.
16. Appearing for the Appellants, Mr. Zaffar Ahmad Shah, learned senior counsel, reiterated the submissions made before the High Court and submitted that, although, the Evacuee Department issued the Notification dated 21st November, 1980, the same was neither gazetted nor implemented till 1999, when an entry was made in the Revenue Records in that regard. Mr. Shah urged that all the Appellants were occupancy tenants in respect of the lands in which they were in possession and such possession was protected under Section 16 of the 2006 Act. The impugned order of the Custodian General, being contrary to the said provisions, was illegal and liable to be quashed.
17. Mr. Shah contended that the lands in question and the lands comprised in the surrounding areas were agricultural lands and had been utilised for cultivation of paddy for decades. There was a change in user of the surrounding lands, when a bye-pass road and a new airport was constructed. As a result of such developments and the expansion of the city, a large number of residential houses and commercial establishments came to be constructed in and around the area called Hyder Pora. On account of such unrestrained construction activities, the level of land used in construction work was raised considerably on account of earth filling. The lands of the Appellants, on the other hand, continued to be low-lying and gradually became receptacles of water, making them unfit for cultivation. In order to render the lands usable, the Appellants also resorted to earth filling to prevent collection and stagnation of water. It is, at this stage, that the functionaries of the Evacuee Department intervened and stopped the Appellants continuing with earth filling of the lands in question.
18. Mr. Shah submitted that after purported ex parte enquiries were made by the Custodian General's Office, letters were issued to the Custodian of Evacuee Property directing him to resume possession of the lands under the occupation of the Appellants. However, the Appellants were kept completely in the dark regarding such enquiry and the procedure adopted by the Office of the Custodian General, in arriving at a final conclusion regarding the status of the land behind the back of the Appellants, was without legal sanction and was liable to be quashed.
19. Mr. Shah urged that the Appellants and their predecessors-in-interest had been holding and possessing the lands in question much before 14thAugust, 1947, in their capacity as tenants and are, therefore, protected in law against any action of the Respondents. Mr. Shah urged that, although, the Respondents claimed that the property in question belongs to one Qamer-ud-Din, he was never in possession of the lands as on 1st March, 1947, or on 14th August, 1947 and the predecessors-in-interest of the Appellants were all along in occupation of the property as tenants and, at no stage, did they cease to occupy the said property.
20. Mr. Shah urged that under Section 5 of the 2006 Act, all evacuee property situated in the State would be deemed to have vested in the Custodian. However, in order to vest in the Custodian, the properties had to be evacuee property. Mr. Shah submitted that in the instant case, Qamer-ud-Din was not an evacuee within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the above Act, nor did he acquire the property in the manner indicated in Section2(c)(iii) thereof. Mr. Shah submitted that the property has not been registered as evacuee property by the Custodian, in terms of Section 5 of the 2006 Act.
21. The learned counsel then submitted that Section 6 of the 2006 Act was unconstitutional and was liable to be struck down. It was urged that before issuing a notification under Section 6 of the 2006 Act, it was only incumbent upon the authorities to ensure that the principles of natural justice were followed.
22. Mr. Shah contended that the 2008 Rules provide that in respect of any evacuee property which vests in the Custodian, but is in the possession of some other person having no lawful title to such possession, the Custodian may evict the person from such property in the manner indicated in the 2006Act and the 2008 Rules.
23. Mr. Bhaskar Gupta, learned Senior Advocate, who appeared for the Appellants, Ghulam Mohammad Dar and others, emphasised the use of the expression ""vacant"" in Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules. Mr. Gupta submitted that the expression ""vacant"" has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary to mean ""empty, unoccupied, absolutely free, and unclaimed"". Accordingly, land in possession of any person prior to coming into force of the Act and the Rules, could not be said to be vacant land and, accordingly, Rule 13-Cof the 2008 Rules would have no application to the lands in question atall.
24. Mr. Gupta submitted that in terms of the Settlement which has been arrived at between the Appellants and the State agencies, the Appellants had surrendered possession of 22 kanals of prime land out of 37 kanals and5 marlas in favour of the Custodian Department and the Appellants continued to be in possession of the remaining lands. Furthermore, according to Mr. Gupta, by the raising of constructions on the surrendered land, the Settlement had been duly acted upon and the State could not, therefore, now resile there from. It was no longer open for the State to contend that they had wrongly arrived at the Settlement.
Mr. Gupta also pointed out that the fact that the Appellants were and continued to be in possession of the lands in question, would be evident also from a letter written on behalf of the State Government, in its Revenue Department, to the Custodian General on 10th October, 2006 regarding the Settlement to be filed in LPA No. 169of 2004 and OWP No. 480 of 2003. It was pointed out that, in the said letter, the State Government had acknowledged the fact that the Appellants were the occupants of the property in question, even though such occupation was referred to as illegal. Mr. Gupta submitted that what was important was the acknowledgement of the fact that the Appellants were in actual possession of the lands in question.
25. It was lastly submitted that Rule 3 of Order 23 CPC permits compromise of suits and where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the same had been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, the Court shall order such agreement, compromise or satisfaction to be recorded and then proceed to pass a decree.
26. Mr. Sunil Fernandes, learned counsel, who appeared for the State of Jammu and Kashmir, submitted that the two writ petitions regarding resumption of possession of the lands in question were still pending before the High Court and the validity of Section 6 of the 2006 Act was the subject matter of challenge therein. The ambit of the dispute between the parties before the High Court was confined to the question of validity of Section 6 of the 2006 Act, as also the challenge to the Settlement arrived at between the parties.
27. Mr. Fernandes urged that the view of the learned third Judge represented the majority view in the matter, which did not warrant any interference. These appeals were, therefore, liable to be dismissed.
28. The main plank of the submissions made on behalf of the Appellants is that the lands in question are not evacuee property, and, that, the Appellants were tenants thereof since before the Act came into force. In fact, it is the case of some of the Appellants that their predecessors-in-interest were in occupation of the lands in question even prior to 1st March, 1947, and 14th August, 1947, which clearly excluded the Appellants from the operation of the provisions of the 2006 Act and the 2008 Rules. On the other hand, as ""protected tenants"", the Appellants were entitled to continue in possession of the lands and, particularly so, in view of the Settlement arrived at between the Appellants and the State authorities.
29. That, there was a settlement arrived at between the parties is not in issue. It is also not in issue that after filing the Settlement in Court and asking the Court to take action thereupon, an application was made on behalf of the Custodian of Evacuee Property, Jammu and Kashmir, for leave to withdraw CMP No. 128 of 2006 on the ground that the Chief Minister had reversed the earlier decision taken on 27/28th March, 2005 and, that, accordingly, the deponent, in the affidavit, was not competent to enter into the Settlement, as the decision to do so had been withdrawn by the competent authority.
30. The question to be decided is whether having entered into a Settlement, which stood concluded and had been acted upon by the State Government by raising constructions on the surrendered lands, could the Settlement have been withdrawn unilaterally only at the instance of the State Government?
31. The other branch of submissions made on behalf of the Appellants, which merits consideration, is whether on Section 8 of the 2006 Act having been declared ultra vires, a party could be left without a remedy as the right to challenge a Notification issued under Section 6 stood extinguished by such declaration?
32. In addition to the above, the provisions of Section 16 of the 2006Act may also be noticed. Section 16, which deals with occupancy and tenancy rights provides as follows: - ""16. Occupancy or tenancy right not to be extinguished - Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the right of occupancy in any land of an evacuee which has vested in the Custodian shall not be extinguished, nor shall an evacuee or the Custodian, whether as an occupancy tenant, or a tenant for a fixed term of any land, be liable to be ejected or deemed to have become so liable on any ground whatsoever for any default of the Custodian.""
It is clear from Section 16 that on account of the non-obstante clause, the provisions of Section 16 will prevail over any other law for the time being in force and the right of occupancy in any land of an evacuee shall not be extinguished. Accordingly, in the event the tenants were enjoying occupancy rights in respect of the lands in their possession, they could not be evicted there from by virtue of the Notification published under Section 6 of the 2006 Act. However, the protection under Section 16 will be available only in respect of evacuee property after a determination to such effect is made. A unilateral declaration is clearly opposed to the principles of natural justice and administrative fair play and cannot be supported.
33. As far as the second limb of Mr. Shah and Mr. Gupta's submissions is concerned, the same being the subject matter of the writ proceeding spending before the High Court, it would not be proper on our part to express any opinion in respect thereof.
34. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are inclined to accept the submission made on behalf of the Appellants that the Notification published on 21st November, 1980, under Section 6 of the 2006 Act, declaring the lands under the possession of the Appellants to be vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property, stood vitiated, as the Appellants had been denied an opportunity of explaining that they were not mere occupants of the property in question, but tenants thereof, in which case, neither the provisions of Rule 9 nor Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules would have any application to the facts of this case.
35. Apart from the above, the Settlement which was entered into between the writ petitioners and the State, was dependent on several factors, including the fact that the occupants of the lands in question had surrendered 22 kanals of prime land out of 37 kanals and 5 marlas in favour of the Custodian Department while remaining in possession of 15 kanals and5 marlas, which were to be settled with them. While, on the one hand, the State authorities took advantage of the Settlement and constructions were raised on the surrendered lands, a stand was later taken on behalf of the State Government that the Settlement stood vitiated on account of non-compliance with the provisions of Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules.
The fact situation of this case is different from the circumstances contemplated under Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules. In the present case, the lands covered by the Settlement were not vacant and were not, therefore, within the ambit of Rule 13-C when the Settlement was at the gestation stage. It is only under the Settlement that the claims and rights, if any, of the writ petitioners were required to be surrendered and, therefore, the question of actual surrender of possession of 22 kanals of land out of 37 kanals and5 marlas, was to follow, leaving a balance of 15 kanals and 5 marlas to be allotted to the occupancy rights and tenants-at-will in respect thereof.
36. The special facts of the case set the present Agreement/Settlement apart from the cases of grant of lease of vacant lands in terms of Rule 13-C and has, therefore, to be treated differently. Firstly, as the lands were not vacant, the very first criterion of Rule 13-C, was not satisfied and the lease of the lands were to be granted as part of the settlement packet, which included surrender of 22 kanals of prime land. We are inclined to agree with the views expressed by Mansoor Ahmad Mir, J. that in the special facts of this case, Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules would have no application to the Settlement arrived at between the parties and the same were not, therefore, vitiated for not putting the lands to auction to determine the premium to be paid for the leases to be granted in respect thereof. As observed by His Lordship, it was nobody's case that the Settlement was the outcome of any fraud or was unlawful and the same, having been signed and acted upon, was binding on the parties and could not be withdrawn unilaterally.
37. In our view, the Settlement arrived at between the parties and filed before the High Court for acceptance by way of CMP No.128 of 2006 is lawful and within the scope of Sub-Rule (3) of Order 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The decision holding the Settlement to be contrary to the provisions of Rule 13-C of the 2008 Rules, as held by H. Imtiyaz Hussain, J. on 15th September, 2007, and affirmed by the third learned Judge, Y.P. Nargotra, J. by his judgment and order dated 25th March, 2008, cannot be sustained and is set aside. Consequently, the view expressed by Mansoor Ahmad Mir, J. is upheld. CMP No.525 of 2006 is, accordingly, dismissed and CMP No.128 of 2006 is allowed. The High Court shall proceed to pass appropriate orders for acceptance of the out-of-Court settlement and for adjustment of the rights of the parties in terms thereof in the LPA as well as in OWP No.480 of 2003 and OWP No.454 of 2005.
38. Since, in these appeals we have only been called upon to consider as to whether the Settlement arrived at between the parties stood vitiated on account of non-compliance with the provisions of Rule 13-C of the 2008Rules, we have not expressed any opinion with regard to the second limb of the submissions advanced regarding the constitutionality of Section 6 of the 2006 Act. The said issue is, accordingly, left to the High Court for decision. We make it clear that whatever has been expressed in this judgment, shall not in any way prejudice and/or affect the outcome of the decision of the High Court in the said matter.
39. The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of. There will, however, be no order as to costs.

"1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. Being aggrieved by an order passed in ITA No.150 of 2008 by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi, the Revenue has filed this appeal.
4. The facts giving rise to the present appeal in a nutshell are as under:
5. The respondent-assessee is a trust, who was treated as an AOP by the Assessing Officer for the assessment year 2002-2003 by an order dated 24th May, 2005 and exemption under Sections 11 & 12 of the Income Tax Act [hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""] had not been continued. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Assessing Officer, the respondent-assessee had preferred an appeal before the Income Tax Commissioner. The Income Tax Commissioner was pleased to dismiss the appeal by an order dated 29th May, 2005. Being aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, the respondent-assessee had filed an appeal before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench ""F"" at New Delhi. The said appeal, being ITA No.2657/DEL/2006, was allowed by an order dated 09th March, 2007. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Revenue had filed ITA No.150 of 2008 before the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi which had been dismissed. Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the said appeal by an order dated 04th March, 2008, the Revenue has filed the present appeal.
6. The facts of the case pertain to the assessment year 2002-2003 of the respondent assessee. During the relevant accounting year i.e. 2001-2002, the respondent-assessee had, by way of donation, received two cheques for a sum of Rs.40 lac each from M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. One of the cheques was dated 22nd April, 2002 and yet it was given in accounting year 2001-2002 i.e. before 31st March, 2002. The said cheque for donation was received by the respondent-assessee before 31st March, 2002 but was honoured after 1st April, 2002 i.e. in accounting year 2002- 2003.
7. In the assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer came to the conclusion that with an intention to do undue favour to M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd., the cheque dated 22nd April, 2002, given by way of donation for a sum of Rs.40 lac had been accepted by the respondent-assessee and receipt for the said amount was also issued before 31st March, 2002 i.e. in the accounting year 2001- 2002. According to the Assessing Officer, many of the trustees of the assessee trust were related to the directors of M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. and so as to give undue advantage under the provisions of Section 80G of the Act, the cheque had been accepted before 31st March, 2002 although the cheque was dated 22nd April, 2002.
Thus, by accepting a post dated cheque and by giving receipt in the earlier accounting year, the assessee trust had done undue favour and, therefore, the Assessing Officer observed as under in para 8 of the Assessment Order: ""This has been primarily done with the sole objective of giving advantage to the donor company M/s Apollo Tyre Ltd. in which the main trustees and their relatives were substantially interested as per provisions of section 13 (3) of the I.T. Act, 1961. This is clearly in violation of provisions of section 13(2) (d) (h) and as such exemption u/s 11 and 12 cannot be allowed to the assessee and the assessment will be made in the status of AOP. With these remarks the income is computed as under""
8. As stated hereinabove, the appeal which was filed against the assessment order had been dismissed and the second appeal filed before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by the respondent- assessee had been allowed by an order dated 09th March, 2007.
9. The Tribunal, after hearing the concerned advocates, came to the conclusion that there was no violation of the provisions of Sections 13 (2)(b) & 13(2)(h) of the Act and the assessee trust had not acted in improper and illegal manner. The Tribunal noted the fact that the amount of donation i.e. Rs.40 lac received by way of a cheque dated 22nd April, 2002 was treated as donation receivable and accordingly accounting treatment was given to the said amount. The said amount was not included in the accounting year 2001-2002 as donation but was shown separately in the balance sheet as amount receivable by way of donation. Moreover, M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. had also not availed benefit of the said amount under Section 80G of the Act during the accounting year 2001-2002 but had availed the benefit only in the accounting year 2002-2003, the period during which the cheque had been honoured and the amount of donation was paid to the assessee trust. For the aforestated reason, the appeal filed by the assessee was allowed.
10. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed in the appeal, the Revenue had filed Income Tax Appeal No.150 of 2008 in the High Court of Delhi. The said appeal has been dismissed and, therefore, the present appeal has been filed by the Revenue.
11. The learned counsel appearing for the Revenue submitted that the High Court committed an error by dismissing the appeal. According to him there was breach of Section 13(2)(b) and 13(2)(h) and he further submitted that though the cheque was dated 22nd April, 2002 it was given by way of donation in the earlier accounting year for which the assessee trust had issued a receipt and as the trustees of the assessee trust and directors of M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. were closely related, an effort was made by the assessee trust to do undue favour to M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd.
12. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the assessee submitted that no illegality or irregularity of whatsoever type was committed by the assessee trust and he had relied upon the reasons recorded by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal so to substantiate his case. He further submitted that the post dated cheque for Rs.40 lac was given before 31st March, 2002 i.e. during the accounting year 2001-2002 and the cheque was duly honoured in April, 2002 when it was presented before the collecting bank. As the cheque had been honoured and the amount was paid to the assessee trust, the date of payment of cheque should be treated as the date on which the cheque was given.
Had the cheque been dishonoured, things would have been different but as the cheque had been duly honoured, as laid down by this court in the case of The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Bombay South, Bombay vs. Messrs. Ogale Glass Works Ltd., Ogale Wadi (1955 (1), SCR page 185), it will have to be presumed that the amount was paid on the date on which the cheque was given to the respondent assessee and, therefore, it cannot be said that any undue favour was done by the respondent-assessee to M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd.
13. Upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we find certain undisputed facts. It is not in dispute that though the assessee trust had issued receipt when it received the cheque dated 22nd April, 2002 for Rs.40 lac in March, 2002, it was clearly stated in its record that the amount of donation was receivable in future and accordingly, the said amount was also shown as donation receivable in the balance sheet prepared by the assessee trust as on 31st March, 2002.
It is also not in dispute that M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. did not avail any advantage of the said donation during the accounting year 2001-2002. Upon perusal of the Assessment Order of M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. for the assessment year 2002-2003, it is clearly revealed that the cheque dated 22nd April, 2002 was not taken into account for giving benefit under Section 80G of the Act as the said amount was paid in April, 2002, when the cheque was honoured. The assessment order showing the above fact is a part of the record, which we have carefully perused.
14. The submission made on behalf of the respondent-assessee is supported by this court in the case of M/s Ogale Glass Works Ltd. (supra). Relying upon other authorities, this court observed as under in the aforesaid case : ""When it is said that a payment by negotiable instrument is a conditional payment what is meant is that such payment is subject to a condition subsequent that if the negotiable instrument is dishonoured on presentation the creditor may consider it as waste paper and resort to his original demand : Stedman v. Gooch (1793) 1 Esp.5. It is said in Benjamin on Sale, 8th Edition, page 788 :-
""The payment takes effect from the delivery of the bill, but is defeated by the happening of the condition, i.e., non-payment at maturity."" In Byles on Bills, 20th Edition, page 23, the position is summarised pithily as follows : ""A cheque, unless dishonoured, is payment."" To the same effect are the passages to be found in Hart on Banking, 4th Edition, Volume I, page 342. In Felix Hadley & Co. v. Hadley (L.R. (1898) 2 Ch.D.680, Byrne J. expressed the same idea in the following passage in his judgment at page 682 : ""In this case I think what took place amounted to a conditional payment of the debt; the condition being that the cheque or bill should be duly met or honoured at the proper date. If that be the true view, then I think the position is exactly as if an agreement had been expressly made that the bill or cheque should operate as payment unless defeated by dishonour or by not being met; and I think that that agreement is implied from giving and taking the cheques and bills in question.
"" The following observations of Lord Maugham in Rhokana Corporation v. Inland Reveue Commissioners (L.R. [1938] AC 380 at p.399) are also apposite: ""Apart from the express terms of section 33, sub-section 1, a similar conclusion might be founded on the well known common law rules as to the effect of the sending of a cheque in payment of a debt, and in the fact that though the payment is subject to the condition subsequent that the cheque must be met on presentation, the date of payment, if the cheque is duly met, is the date when the cheque was posted.""
In the case before us none of the cheques has been dishonoured on presentation and payment cannot, therefore, be said to have been defeated by the happening of the condition subsequent, namely dishonour by non-payment and that being so there can be no question, therefore, that the assessee did not receive payment by the receipt of the cheques. The position, therefore, is that in one view of the matter there was, in the circumstances of this case, an implied agreement under which the cheques were accepted unconditionally as payment and on another view, even if the cheques were taken conditionally, the cheques not having been dishonoured but having been cashed, the payment related back to the dates of the receipt of the cheques and in law the dates of payments were the dates of the delivery of the cheques.""
15. Looking into the afore stated undisputed facts, and the view expressed by this court in the case of M/s Ogale Glass Works Ltd. (supra), we are of the view that no irregularity had been committed by the assessee trust and there was no violation of the provisions of Sections 13(2)(b) or 13(2)(h) of the Act. The fact that most of the trustees of the assessee trust and the directors of M/s Apollo Tyres Ltd. are related is absolutely irrelevant.
16. Upon careful perusal of the order passed by the Tribunal, we do not find any error therein. We are, therefore, in agreement with the view expressed by the Tribunal as well as the High Court and, therefore, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.",1
"1. Leave granted.
2. Consequent upon the creation of posts of Assistant Surgeons, the Health and Medical Education Department of the State of Jammu & Kashmir, addressed a requisition to the Jammu & Kashmir Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as ""the Public Service Commission"") to recruit 1255 posts of Assistant Surgeons. Based on the aforesaid requisition, the Public Service Commission issued a notification dated 31.12.1996 for inviting applications for 1255 posts of Assistant Surgeons in the pay-scale of Rs.2200-4000. Based on the aforesaid notification, an advertisement dated 2.1.1997 appeared in newspapers inviting applications for 1255 posts of Assistant Surgeons, belonging to the Health and Medical Education Department.
3. In June, 1997 the Public Service Commission after completing the process of selection, prepared a select list of successful candidates. The names of the appellants herein, appeared in the list of successful candidates. Consequent upon the selection of the appellants as Assistant Surgeons by the Public Service Commission, the Department of Health and Medical Education, issued an order dated 12.8.1997 appointing the appellants against the advertised posts of Assistant Surgeons. An extract of the aforesaid order, relevant to the present controversy, is being reproduced hereunder: ""The candidates belonging to Jammu region shall report to Director Health Services, Jammu and those belonging to Kashmir region to Director Health Services Kashmir for further postings. As regards migrant candidates they shall report to Director, Health Services Jammu for further orders."" (emphasis is ours) It is not a matter of dispute, that in furtherance of the order of appointment dated 12.8.1997, all the appellants reported to the Director, Health Services, Jammu as they all belonged to the Jammu region. The next step, as is evident from the extracted portion of the appointment order, was the appellants' actual posting.
4. A Government Order pertaining to the posting of Assistant Surgeons, was issued by the Department of Health and Medical Education on 17.7.1997. Paragraph 5 of the aforesaid Government Order is relevant, and is accordingly being extracted hereunder: ""5. The Doctors appointed against General category shall be posted in various Hospitals in the following orders:
a. Allopathic Dispensaries
b. Primary Health Centres and Police Hospitals;
c. Community Health Centres;
d. Sub-District Hospitals;
e. District Hospitals;
f. Hospitals of Jammu and Srinagar including Evening/Urban Clinic and after that in Medical Education and other organizations;
g. Surgeons shall be posted only in such Hospitals where Operation Theatres are available and the Hospitals are housed in Govt. Buildings."" Sub-paragraph (f) of paragraph 5 extracted hereinabove leaves no room for any doubt, that Assistant Surgeons could be posted in Hospitals of Jammu and Srinagar including evening/urban clinics, ""and after that"", in medical education and other organizations. In consonance with the Government Order dated 17.7.1997, the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu, by an Office Order dated 30.12.1997, posted all the appellants against the vacant posts of Senior/Junior House Officers, at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and at hospitals associated with the said college).
5. Despite posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith), on 30.12.1997; within a week thereof, by an order dated 7.1.1998, the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu, reverted the appellants to their parent Department, namely, the Directorate of Health Service, Jammu. The instant order dated 7.1.1978 was first assailed by the appellants before the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir (hereinafter referred to as ""the High Court""). It is now the subject matter of challenge by them, before this Court. Since the present controversy relates to the order dated 7.1.1998, whereby, the appellants were ordered to be reverted/repatriated to their parent department, the same is being extracted hereunder:
""Consequent to the appointment of house surgeons in the various specialities in this institution, the Assistant Surgeons, who were temporarily deployed from the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu to meet the exigency of shortage of doctors in Govt. Medical College, Jammu, are hereby reverted to their parent department. The doctors listed in Annexure-I attached hereto stand relieved today the 7th January, 1998 forenoon with the direction to report for duty to the Director Health Services, Jammu."" (emphasis is ours) A perusal of the order extracted hereinabove discloses the basis of the alleged repatriation of the appellants to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu.
Firstly, the appellants' parent department is described as, the Directorate of Health Services. Secondly, the appellants posting as Senior/Junior House Officers, was disclosed. Namely, to meet the exigency of shortage of doctors at the Government Medical College, Jammu. And thirdly, that the aforesaid posting was depicted as a temporary deployment from the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu. Besides the main order dated 7.1.1998 extracted above, it is also relevant to reproduce the endorsement made at serial no.2 of the aforesaid order, to the Director, Health Services, Jammu. The same is therefore being extracted below: ""2. Director Health Services, Jammu. This is in reference to his verbal request for reversion of the Assistant Surgeons to the directorate to meet immediate needs in the health services."" (emphasis is ours) A perusal of the aforesaid endorsement discloses the fourth reason for the alleged repatriation of the appellants to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu, namely, to meet the immediate needs of the Department of Health Services.
6. So as to assail the order dated 7.1.1998 whereby the appellants were repatriated to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu, three writ petitions came to be filed before the High Court. The details of the writ petitions are being narrated hereinbelow: i) Dr.Shazia Hamid vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir (SWP no.35/98) ii) Dr.Rajni Malhotra vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir (SWP no.36/98) iii) Dr.Sarita vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir (SWP no.37/98) Having entertained the aforesaid writ petitions, the High Court issued the following interim directions, on 8.1.1998: ""The grievance of the petitioners is that they have been deployed to the Government Medical College Jammu by the Director Health Services, Jammu and the Principal Medical College, Jammu has further posted them in Medical College, Jammu.
They are being relieved by the person of the Principal Government Medical College Jammu who is having no authority to transfer them and direct them to report back to Director Health Services, Jammu. Issue notice to the respondents, issue notice in the CMP also. In the meanwhile, respondents are directed not to disturb the status of the petitioners till objections are filed and considered by this Court."" We are informed, that in compliance with the said interim directions, all the appellants continued to discharge their duties at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith). And that eversince, upto the present juncture, despite the impugned order (passed by the Letters Patent Bench, of the High Court) having been passed against them, the appellants posting has remained unaltered. Even now, they are discharging their duties at the Government Medical College, Jammu, (and/or the hospitals associated therewith).
7. It is also relevant to mention herein, that the main ground on which the appellants had assailed the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 before the High Court was, that the same was not issued by the competent authority. In this behalf, it was the case of the appellants, that the Secretary, Department of Health and Medical Education being the appointing authority of the appellants; the Principal Medical College, Jammu, had no jurisdiction to issue the order dated 7.1.1998. It seems to us, that in order to get over the main ground of attack raised at the behest of the appellants, the Health,
Family Welfare and Medical Education Department, issued another order on 20.4.1998, with the same effect and consequences. The aforesaid order is also being extracted hereunder: ""Whereas for public health care 1230 posts of Assistant Surgeons were created vide Government Order No.129-HD of 1996 dated 4.12.96 under special recruitment drive programme and referred to Public Service Commission for selection of suitable candidates. Whereas public service commission vide their letter No.PSC/1/Dr/AS/5- 96 dated 10.6.97 recommended a panel of 1097 candidates for appointment of Assistant Surgeons. Whereas the Health, FW and Medical Education Deptt issued appointment orders in favour of 1097 Assistant Surgeons and directed the two directors of Health Services to post these doctors in rural areas and other places in pursuance of guidelines as embodied in Government Order no.635 HME of 1997 dated 17.7.97.
Whereas the two directors of Health Services in violation of standing Government Orders deputed/attached/adjusted/detailed to work a good number of new appointments in various health institutions and offices thus defeating the very object of special recruitment drive. Now therefore in the public interest and health care the said Assistant Surgeons are hereby detached with immediate effect from the places where they have been deputed/attached/adjusted or detailed to work as the case may be and shall report to respective directors of Health Services who shall post them strictly in accordance with the guidelines as detailed in Government Order no.635 HME of 1997 dated 17.7.97 and report compliance to the Administrative Department within fortnight positively."" (emphasis is ours)
The order extracted hereinabove narrates, the exact sequence of events leading to the eventual posting of the appellants, consequent upon their selection as Assistant Surgeons. It also needs to be emphasized, that the order dated 20.4.1998 highlights the fact, that the original posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith), had been made by the Director of Health Services, in violation of Government Orders, and further that, their repatriation to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu was in public interest.
8. A learned Single Judge of the High Court on 28.5.1998, allowed all the three writ petitions (wherein the order dated 7.1.1998 had been assailed). According to the understanding of the learned Single Judge, the concerned employees consent, prior to their appointment on deputation was mandatory. Absence of consent, according to the learned Single Judge, established that their appointment at the Government Medical College, Jammu, (and/or at hospitals associated therewith), was not by way of deputation.
Since in the present case, the consent of the appellants had admittedly not been obtained prior to their posting vide order dated 30.12.1997, the learned Single Judge concluded, inter alia, that the authorities had wrongly assumed, that the posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith), was by way of deputation. Accordingly, the learned Single Judge held, that there was no question of the reversion of the appellants to their parent department. For, according to the learned Single Judge, the Government Medical College Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith) comprised of the appellants parent department. Based thereon, the learned Single Judge felt, that the reversion/repatriation of the appellants to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu, lacked legal sanction.
9. The learned Single Judge also relied upon the Government Order dated 17.7.1997 in order to conclude, that the posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith) was not beyond their cadre. Referring to paragraph 5(f) thereof, the learned Single Judge felt, that the posting of the appellants was within the scope of the conditions of their employment.
10. Besides the aforesaid, the learned Single Judge also arrived at the conclusion, that the Principal, Medical College, Jammu had no jurisdiction whatsoever to issue the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 reverting/repatriating the appellants to the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu. In this behalf, the learned Single Judge felt, that the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu had passed the order dated 7.1.1998, in his capacity as Head of the Department, which was not in consonance with the factual/legal position.
11. The learned Single Judge summarized his conclusions as under: ""In view of the above, it is held that:
i. The petitioners came to be appointed as Assistant Surgeons.
ii. The Commissioner/Secretary in the Health and Education Department passed clear orders on 17th July, 1997 that the petitioners be appointed in Jammu Hospitals.
iii. That the Director Health Services merely performed ministerial act of issuing letter of appointments. He acted in compliance of the Government Orders.
iv. That the petitioner came to be appointed against available vacancies.
v. The concept of the petitioner being on deputation would not be attracted to the facts of this case. This is because this was the first appointments of the petitioners. The concept of parent department and department to which an employee is to be temporarily sent on deputation is missing in this case.
vi. The fine distinction pointed out on the basis of Rules of Business may be legally correct, but no factual foundation has been laid down for sustaining the argument as projected by the State counsel.
vii. That the order passed during the period when Model Code of Conduct was in operation and when election process was on, was also not in accordance with law."" Accordingly, the learned Single Judge set aside the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 passed by the Principal, Medical College, Jammu..
12. Dissatisfied with the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court on 28.5.1998, the State Government preferred Letters Patent Appeals. Suffice it to state, that while disposing of the Letters Patent Appeals, the common decision rendered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, was set aside by the Division Bench on 24.2.2006. The appellants before us, have raised a challenge to the order passed by the Division Bench on 24.2.2006.
13. The first Civil Appeal being disposed of by the instant common order, has been filed by Dr.Kavi Raj and others, whereas the second one has been filed by Dr.Reva Gaind and others. Leaned counsel for the appellants, at the very inception informed us, that the first Civil Appeal survives in respect of only five appellants, namely, Dr.Kanchan Anand, Dr.Arpana Sharma, Dr.Mehbooba Begum, Dr.Nidhi Sharma and Dr.Shama Parveen Bhat. As against the second Civil Appeal, it was stated to be surviving only in respect of Dr.Reva Gaind, Dr.Rachna Wattal, Dr.Mala Mandla, Dr.Karuna Wazir, Dr.Ila Gupta, Dr.Simi Kandhari, Dr.Indu Raina, Dr.Shivani Malhotra and Dr.Surekha Bhat. It is therefore apparent, that the instant two Civil Appeals are presently surviving only in respect of 14 of the appellants, fully described above.
14. In order to canvass the claim of the appellants, learned counsel invited our attention to the order of the Principal, Medical College, Jammu dated 30.12.1997, whereby, the appellants were assigned their first posting as Senior/Junior House Officers in different departments of the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith). Based thereon, it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel, that the Division Bench of the High Court seriously erred in holding that the appellants were appointed by way of deputation to the Government Medical College, Jammu. To further the contention, that the appellants were not appointed to the Government Medical College, Jammu by way of deputation, it was pointed out, that the posts of Assistant Surgeons against which the appellants were appointed were created by the Health and Medical Education Department.
The requisition to fill up 1255 posts of Assistant Surgeons, was also addressed by the Health and Medical Education Department, to the Public Service Commission. It was sought to be canvassed, that the Government Medical College, Jammu, was a part and parcel of the Department of Health and Medical Education, and as such, it was submitted, that the posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith) cannot be deemed to be a posting by way of deputation. It was accordingly submitted, that the appellants posting could not be deemed to be in a cadre, other than the cadre to which they were substantively appointed. Based on the aforesaid submission, learned counsel for the appellants endeavoured to suggest, that the conclusions recorded by the learned Single Judge were fully justified, and in consonance with law. Learned counsel accordingly prayed that the impugned order dated 24.2.2006 be set aside.
15. In addition to the submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, as has been noticed in the foregoing paragraph, it was also his vehement contention, that the posting of the appellants was in consonance with the express instructions of the State Government.
In this behalf, learned counsel placed reliance on the Government Order dated 17.7.1997, whereby norms for issuing posting orders of candidates freshly selected against the post of Assistant Surgeons, were laid down. Placing reliance on paragraph 5(f) of the aforesaid Government Order dated 17.7.1997 (extracted in paragraph 4 hereinabove) it was submitted, that the posting of the appellants against the vacancies in the Directorate of Medical Education, was clearly within the purview of their selection to posts in the Health and Medical Education Department. Since the posting of the appellants was made in consonance with the Government Order dated 17.7.1997, it was contended, that it was natural to infer that the same was within the cadre to which they were selected and appointed.
It was therefore submitted, that the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 passed by the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu, must be deemed to have been issued on a misunderstanding, that the posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or hospital associated therewith) was beyond the scope of their legitimate posting. For the aforesaid reason also, it was contended that the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 needed to be set aside.
16. We may also place on record the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants, on the same lines as the determination rendered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. To avoid repetition, reference may be made to paragraph 8 above. Learned counsel, endorsed the aforesaid factual/legal position.
17. In response to the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, the contentions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, though exhaustive during hearing, are being summarised hereunder, for an overview:
i. The Department of Health and Medical Education comprises of two independent Directorates, namely, the Directorate of Health Services and the Directorate of Medical Education. The posts of Assistant Surgeons, against which the appellants were selected and appointed belonged to the cadre of posts, under the Directorate of Health Services.
ii. Whereas, at the time of selection and appointment of the appellants, the Directorate of Health Services had a cadre of Assistant Surgeons, the Directorate of Medical Education, which included the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or hospitals associated therewith), did not have any post of Assistant Surgeons. Therefore, the posting of the appellants, at the Government Medical College Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith) could only have been by way of deputation.
iii. Cadres under the Directorate of Health Services, as well as, the cadres under the Directorate of Medical Education are regulated by separate rules. While the Jammu & Kashmir Medical Education (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1979, govern the conditions of service of gazetted employees of the Directorate of Medical Education; the Jammu & Kashmir Medical (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1970 regulate the recruitment of gazetted employees, in the Directorate of Health Services. Under the 1979 Rules referred to above, there was no post of Assistant Surgeons. Therefore the posts of Assistant Surgeon, were clearly not included in the cadre of posts under the Directorate of Medical Education. It was also pointed out, that the post of Assistant Surgeon figure in the 1970 Rules referred to above, and as such, the posts of Assistant Surgeon, find a definite place in the cadre of posts, under the Directorate of Health Services. It was sought to be inferred from the above factual/legal position, that the appointment of the appellants was in the Directorate of Health Services, and their posting at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therewith) was by way of deputation.
iv. Referring to the impugned order passed by the Division Bench dated 24.2.2006, it was pointed out, that the appellants before this Court had not disputed a vital factual position recorded therein, namely, that the salary of the appellants continued to be drawn from the Directorate of Health Services, for the entire duration during which the appellants had been rendering service at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therein). It was submitted, that this factual position is sufficient to establish, that the appointment of the appellants was to the Directorate of Health Services, and not in the Directorate of Medical Education.
18. Having given our thoughtful consideration, to the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the rival parties, we are of the view, that the submissions advanced on behalf of the respondents, as have been summarized above are unexceptionable. It is therefore, not possible for us to accept that the appointment of the appellants was substantively made to a cadre under the Director of Medical Education. We are also of the view, that the appointment of the appellants in the Directorate of Medical Education, was clearly by way of deputation. Their posting at the Government Medical College Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therewith) was most certainly beyond their parent cadre, and therefore, by way of deputation. The reasons for our aforesaid conclusions, are being recorded in the following paragraphs.
19. Even though it is clear, that the posts of Assistant Surgeons were created by the Health and Medical Education Department of the State Government, it is also clear that the aforesaid department is comprised of two independent Directorates, namely, the Directorate of Health Services and the Directorate of Medical Education. The employees of each of the two Directorates are governed by a separate set of rules. The rules governing the conditions of service of gazetted employees of the Directorate of Medical Education, do not have the posts of Assistant Surgeons.
The cadre of Assistant Surgeons is only found in the rules of recruitment applicable to gazettled employees of the Directorate of Health Service. Secondly, the assertion made at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, that there were no posts of Assistant Surgeon when the appellants were selected and posted at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therewith), in the Directorate of Medical Education, has not been disputed by the learned counsel for the appellants. In the absence of any posts of Assistant Surgeon in the Directorate of Medical Education, it is impossible to infer that the appellants (who were selected against the posts of Assistant Surgeons) could have belonged to the Directorate of Medical Education. Furthermore, consequent upon the selection of the appellants by the Public Service Commission they were issued appointment orders dated 12.8.1997. A relevant extract of the aforesaid appointment order, has been reproduced above.
A perusal of the same reveals, that such of the candidates who had been selected as Assistant Surgeons, and belonged to Jammu region, were to report to the Director, Health Services, Jammu. Whereas, those belonging to the Kashmir region, were to report to the Director, Health Services, Kashmir. The Directors of Health Services, Jammu as well as Kashmir, are admittedly incharge of the administrative chain of command, in the respective Directorates of Health Services. This by itself demonstrates, that the appointment of the appellants was to the Directorate of Health Services, and not in the Directorate of Medical Education. Fourthly, the order issued by the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu dated 30.12.1997 reveals, that the appellants were being posted as Senior/Junior House Officers. The posts of Senior/Junior House Officer are distinct and separate from the posts of Assistant Surgeons.
The posts of Senior/Junior House Officers, are included in the cadre of posts in the Directorate of Medical Education. The appellants posting as Senior/Junior House Officers also exhibits, that their appointment was not within the Directorate of Health Services, but was against posts outside the Directorate of Health Services. Furthermore, even the impugned order dated 7.1.1998 noted, that the appellants were being temporarily deployed ""from the Directorate of Health Services, Jammu"" to meet the exigency of shortage of doctors at the Government Medical College, Jammu. Sixthly, the endorsement at serial no.2 of the order dated 7.1.1998 (extracted in paragraph 5 above) reveals, that a request was made by the by the Director,
Health Services, Jammu, that the appellants be reverted to the Directorate of Health Services, to meet the needs of the said service. Seventhly, the order of the Department of Health and Medical Education dated 20.4.1998 reveals, that the posting of the appellants at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at hospitals associated therewith), was made by the two Directors of Health Services in violation of Government Orders, thereby, defeating the very purpose for which the appellants were selected and appointed. Lastly, is the unrefuted assertion at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the salary of the appellants continued to be drawn from the Directorate of Health Services, for the entire duration during which the appellants remained posted at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therewith).
Had the appellants been legitimately working within their own cadre, their salary would undoubtedly have been drawn from the funds of the Directorate of Medical Education. This factual position puts a final seal on the matter, as it does not leave any room for any further imagination. Based on the disbursement of salary to the appellants from the funds of Directorate of Health Services, the appellants must be deemed to be substantive employees of the cadre of Assistant Surgeons of the Directorate of Health Services. There is therefore no room for any doubt, that the appellants were substantively appointed to the Directorate of Health Services, and not in the Directorate of Medical Education.
20. Before concluding, it is essential to deal with certain inferences drawn by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. According to the learned Single Judge, prior consent of an employee is imperative, binding, peremptory and mandatory, before he is posted on deputation outside his parent department. No statutory rule has been brought to our notice, requiring prior consent of an employee, before his deployment against a post beyond his parent cadre. The mere fact, that the appellants consent was not sought before their posting at the Government Medical College, Jammu (and/or at the hospitals associated therewith) would not, in our view have any determinative effect on the present controversy.
Broadly, an employee can only be posted (or transferred) to a post against which he is selected. This would ensure his stationing, within the cadre of posts, under his principal employer. His posting may, however, be regulated differently, by statutory rules, governing his conditions of service. In the absence of any such rules, an employee cannot be posted (or transferred) beyond the cadre to which he is selected, without his willingness/readiness. Therefore, an employee's posting (or transfer), to a department other than the one to which he is appointed, against his will, would be impermissible. But willingness of posting beyond the cadre (and/or parent department) need not be expressly sought.
It can be implied. It need not be in the nature of a written consent. Consent of posting (or transfer) beyond the cadre (or parent department) is inferable from the conduct of the employee, who does not protest or contest such posting/transfer. In the present controversy, the appellants were issued posting orders by the Principal, Government Medical College, Jammu, dated 30.12.1997. They accepted the same, and assumed charge as Senior/Junior House Officers at the Government Medical College, Jammu, despite their selection and appointment as Assistant Surgeons. Even now, they wish to continue to serve against posts, in the Directorate of Medical Education. There cannot be any doubt, about their willingness/readiness to serve with the borrowing Directorate. The consent of the appellants is tacit and unquestionable. We are therefore of the view, that the learned Single Judge of the High Court, clearly erred on the instant aspect of the matter.
21. For the reasons expressed hereinabove, we are satisfied, that the impugned order passed by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court on 24.2.2006, does not suffer from any factual or legal infirmity. The same is therefore, affirmed.
22. Despite having recorded our conclusions on the merits of the controversy, it is also essential for us to take into consideration a technical plea advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants, that consequent upon the decision by the learned Single Judge (dated 28.5.1998), whereby, the impugned order of reversion/repatriation of the appellants to the Directorate of Health Services dated 7.1.1998 was set aside, two Letters Patent Appeals, i.e., LPA (SW) no.88 of 2000, and LPA (SW) no.89 of 2000 were filed by the respondents herein (to impugn the common order dated 28.5.1998, passed by the learned Single Judge). In the first of the aforesaid Letters Patent Appeals, 18 Assistant Surgeons were impleaded as respondents, whereas, in the second Letters Patent Appeal 24 Assistant Surgeons were impleaded as respondents.
It was pointed out, that the Letters Patent Appeal (SW) no.88 of 2000 was dismissed in default.. The said Letters Patent Appeal was never restored. As such, it was submitted, that the order passed by the learned Single Judge on 28.5.1998, relating to 18 Assistant Surgeons, (impleaded as respondents therein), attained finality. Based on the aforesaid uncontroverted position, it was submitted, that it is imperative for the State Government, now to give effect to the order of the learned Single Judge dated 28.5.1998, pertaining to the aforesaid 18 Assistant Surgeons, (impleaded as respondents in LPA(SW) no.88 of 2000).
In the aforesaid view of the matter, it was further submitted, that the binding effect in connection with the 18 Assistant Surgeons, should be extended to the remaining 24 Assistant Surgeons (who had been arrayed as respondents in LPA (SW) no.89 of 2000. This, according to the learned counsel for the appellants, would also meet the ends of justice, inasmuch as, all similarly situated individuals, must be placed similarly. According to learned counsel, if this position is not accepted, the appellants would be deprived of their right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the laws, guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
23. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the aforesaid technical plea advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants. It is not a matter of dispute, that LPA (SW) no.89 of 2000 was a",1
"1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. These appeals arising out of the aforesaid special leave petitions have been filed against the judgment and order dated 15.07.2010 in R.P. No. 2032 of 2010 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as ""the National Commission""), New Delhi.
4. Relevant facts are taken from Special Leave Petition (C) No.26043 of 2010.
5. The appellant and respondent No.2, who are doctors, conducted an operation on the left leg of the husband of the complainant. Sometime after the operation, the patient died on 13.07.2008. Respondent No. 1, wife of the deceased, filed a complaint against the appellant and respondent No.2, before the District Consumer Forum. We may notice here that respondent No.2 is the appellant in Civil Appeal No. of 2013 arising out of SLP(C) No.1495 of 2011.
The complaint was duly registered and notice was issued to the appellant and respondent No.2. Against the issuance of the notice, the appellant filed a revision petition before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Hyderabad on the ground that the complaint could not have been registered by the District Forum without seeking an opinion of an expert in terms of the decision of the Supreme Court reported in Martin F. D'Souza Vs. Mohd. Ishfaq (2009) 3 SCC 1. In this revision petition, respondent No.2 filed IA No.2240 of 2009 praying for stay of proceedings before the District Consumer Forum. The State Commission rejected the revision petition by granting liberty to the appellant to file the necessary application before the District Forum to refer the matter to an expert.
He did not file any application before the District Forum, but challenged the aforesaid order of the State Commission by filing revision petition No. 2032 of 2010 before the National Commission. The revision petition has been dismissed by the National Commission by relying upon the subsequent judgment of this Court in V. Kishan Rao Vs. Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital & Anr. (2010) 5 SCC 513, wherein this Court has declared that the judgment rendered in Martin F. D'Souza (supra) is per incuriam. Hence the present special leave petitions challenging the aforesaid order of the National Commission dated 15.07.2010.
6. Heard Mr. Rao, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and respondent No.2 and Mr. K.K. Kishore, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No.1, at length.
7. Mr. Rao has tried to persuade us that the judgment of this Court in the case of V. Kishan Rao Vs. Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital & Anr. (supra), has erroneously declared the earlier judgment of this Court in the case of Martin F. D'Souza Vs. Mohd. Ishfaq (supra) as per incuriam, on a misconception of the law laid down by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Jacob Mathew Vs. State of Punjab & Anr., (2005) 6 SCC 1.
We are not inclined to accept the submission made by Mr. Rao. The judgment in Jacob Mathew (supra) is clearly confined to the question of medical negligence leading to criminal prosecution, either on the basis of a criminal complaint or on the basis of an FIR. The conclusions recorded in paragraph 48 of Jacob Mathew (supra) leave no manner of doubt that in the aforesaid judgment this Court was concerned with a case of medical negligence which resulted in prosecution of the concerned doctor under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code. We may notice here the relevant conclusions which are summed up by this Court as under:
""(5) The jurisprudential concept of negligence differs in civil and criminal law. What may be negligence in civil law may not necessarily be negligence in criminal law. For negligence to amount to an offence, the element of mens rea must be shown to exist. For an act to amount to criminal negligence, the degree of negligence should be much higher i.e. gross or of a very high degree. Negligence which is neither gross nor of a higher degree may provide a ground for action in civil law but cannot form the basis for prosecution.
(6) The word 'gross' has not been used in Section 304A of IPC, yet it is settled that in criminal law negligence or recklessness, to be so held, must be of such a high degree as to be 'gross'. The expression 'rash or negligent act' as occurring in Section 304A of the IPC has to be read as qualified by the word 'grossly'.
(7) To prosecute a medical professional for negligence under criminal law it must be shown that the accused did something or failed to do something which in the given facts and circumstances no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence would have done or failed to do. The hazard taken by the accused doctor should be of such a nature that the injury which resulted was most likely imminent.
(8) Res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence and operates in the domain of civil law specially in cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence. It cannot be pressed in service for determining per se the liability for negligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited application in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.""
8. The guidelines in Paragraph 48 were laid down after rejecting the submission that in both jurisdictions i.e. under civil law and criminal law, negligence is negligence, and jurisprudentially no distinction can be drawn between negligence under civil law and negligence under criminal law. It was observed that :- ""12.................................................................................. The submission so made cannot be countenanced inasmuch as it is based upon a total departure from the established terrain of thought running ever since the beginning of the emergence of the concept of negligence up to the modern times. Generally speaking, it is the amount of damages incurred which is determinative of the extent of liability in tort; but in criminal law it is not the amount of damages but the amount and degree of negligence that is determinative of liability.
To fasten liability in criminal law, the degree of negligence has to be higher than that of negligence enough to fasten liability for damages in civil law. The essential ingredient of mens rea cannot be excluded from consideration when the charge in a criminal court consists of criminal negligence. 28. A medical practitioner faced with an emergency ordinarily tries his best to redeem the patient out of his suffering. He does not gain anything by acting with negligence or by omitting to do an act. Obviously, therefore, it will be for the complainant to clearly make out a case of negligence before a medical practitioner is charged with or proceeded against criminally.
A surgeon with shaky hands under fear of legal action cannot perform a successful operation and a quivering physician cannot administer the end-dose of medicine to his patient. 29. If the hands be trembling with the dangling fear of facing a criminal prosecution in the event of failure for whatever reason - whether attributable to himself or not, neither can a surgeon successfully wield his life-saving scalpel to perform an essential surgery, nor can a physician successfully administer the life-saving dose of medicine. Discretion being the better part of valour, a medical professional would feel better advised to leave a terminal patient to his own fate in the case of emergency where the chance of success may be 10% (or so), rather than taking the risk of making a last ditch effort towards saving the subject and facing a criminal prosecution if his effort fails. Such timidity forced upon a doctor would be a disservice to society.""
9. The aforesaid observations leave no manner of doubt that the observations in Jacob Mathew (supra) were limited only with regard to the prosecution of doctors for the offence under Section 304A IPC.
10. The aforesaid observations and conclusions leave no manner of doubt that the judgment rendered by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Martin F. D'Souza (supra) has been correctly declared per incuriam by the judgment in V. Kishan Rao (supra) as the law laid down in Martin F. D'Souza (supra) was contrary to the law laid down in Jacob Mathew (supra).
11. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the conclusions recorded by the National Commission in the impugned order does not call for any interference. The civil appeals are dismissed.

"1. Leave granted.
2. These Appeals raise an interesting issue relating to the powers of the Speaker of the Orissa Legislative Assembly under Rule 6(1) and (2) of the Members of Orissa Legislative Assembly (Disqualification On Ground Of Defection) Rules, 1987, hereinafter referred to as ""the 1987 Rules"", in the wake of paragraphs 2(1)(a) and 8 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India and are taken up together for disposal. The facts giving rise to the said legal question are set out here in below.
3. The Appellant herein is the Speaker of the Orissa Legislative Assembly. There were four elected members of the National Congress Party(NCP) in the Orissa Legislative Assembly. All the said four elected members of the NCP joined the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which is the Ruling Party in the State of Orissa. On account of such defection, Respondent, Shri Utkal Keshari Parida, who is the President of the State Unit of the NCP in the State of Orissa, filed four separate Disqualification Petitions before the Appellant for disqualification of the said four elected members of the NCP. The Disqualification Petitions were placed before the Appellant on 24.07.2012 and copies thereof were forwarded to the concerned Members of the Legislative Assembly, in terms of Rule 7(3) of the 1987 Rules.
4. Inasmuch as, the matter was being delayed, the Respondent filed Writ Petition (C) No. 14869 of 2012, before the Orissa High Court, inter alia, for a direction to the Speaker of the Assembly to dispose of the Disqualification Petitions expeditiously. Before the Division Bench of the said High Court, an objection was taken regarding the maintainability of the Writ Petition at the instance of the Respondent, who though being the President of the State Unit of the NCP, was not a Member of the Legislative Assembly, in view of the provisions of Sub-rule (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules. Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules, which is relevant for our purpose, is extracted here in below:
1. ""No reference of any question as to whether a Member has become subject to disqualification under the Tenth Schedule shall be made except by a petition in relation to such Member made in accordance with the provisions of this rule.
2. A petition in relation to a Member may be made in writing to the Speaker by any other Member: Provided that a petition in relation to the Speaker shall be addressed to the Secretary.
3. The Secretary shall:-
a. as soon as may be after the receipt of a petition under the proviso to sub-rule (2) make a report in respect thereof to the House ; and
b. as soon as may be after the House has elected a Member in pursuance of the proviso to sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule place the petition before such Member.
4. Before making any petition in relation to any Member, the petitioner shall satisfy himself that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a question has arisen as to whether such Member has become subject to disqualification under the Tenth Schedule.
5. Every petition:
a. shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies; and
b. shall be accompanied by copies of the documentary evidence, if any, on which the petitioner relies and where the petitioner relies on any information furnished to him by any person, a statement containing the names and addresses of such persons and the gist of such information as furnished by each such person.
6. Every petition shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), for the verification of pleadings.
7. Every annexure to the petition shall also be signed by the petitioner and verified in the same manner as the petition.
5. ""Relying on the interpretation of the aforesaid Rule in the judgment delivered by this Court in Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh v. Chairman, Bihar Legislative Council and Others, [(2004) 8 SCC 747], the High Court came to the conclusion that the Writ Petition was maintainable at the instance of the Respondent herein. While arriving at such conclusion, the High Court also took into consideration the decision in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu and Others, [1992 Supp (2) SCC 651] and the provisions of Article 191 read with paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
6. Interpreting the provisions of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules, the High Court also took into consideration the judgment of this Court in Rajendra Singh Rana and Others v. Swami Prasad Maurya and Others, [(2007) 4 SCC270], in which reference had been made to another decision in the case of Prakash Singh Badal v. Union of India, [AIR 1987 P & H 263]. On a consideration of the said two decisions and the other decisions already referred to hereinbefore, the High Court came to the conclusion that it was abundantly clear that if any Member of the House belonging to a political party had joined another political party, which is a disqualification under paragraph 2(1) of the Tenth Schedule, any person interested could make a reference to the Speaker under Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules and it was not necessary that such a reference had to be made by a Member of the Legislative Assembly. On its aforesaid finding, the High Court rejected the contentions made on behalf of the Appellant and held that the same were maintainable under Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules.
7. This Appeal has been preferred by the Speaker of the Orissa Legislative Assembly questioning the aforesaid decision of the High Court.
8. Appearing in support of the Appeals, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Advocate, submitted that the High Court had wrongly interpreted the provisions of Sub-rules (1) and (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules in arriving at the erroneous conclusion that the Disqualification Petitions under Rules6 and 7 of the 1987 Rules could be made not only by Members of the House, but by any interested person also. Mr. Venugopal urged that the language of Sub-rule (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules clearly indicates that it is only a Member of the House, who in relation to a petition for disqualification of another Member, could apply to the Speaker. Mr. Venugopal urged that giving any other interpretation to the said provisions would do violence to and be contrary to the intention contained in Rule 6of the 1987 Rules. Mr. Venugopal urged that after the impugned judgment was delivered by the High Court, the matter was referred by the Speaker to the Committee of Privileges of the House on 15.10.2012 under Rule 7(4) of the1987 Rules. The meeting of the said Committee was convened on 22.12.2012, but no business could be conducted in the meeting on account of lack of quorum.
9. On 2.1.2013, a meeting of the Committee of Privileges was convened to finalise the modalities for hearing of the Disqualification Petitions filed on behalf of the Respondent. However, before the matter came to be decided by the Committee of Privileges, the Special Leave Petition was filed to set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court holding that the Disqualification Petitions were maintainable at the instance of anon-Member of the House.
10. Mr. Venugopal urged that in the light of the explicit language used in Sub-rule (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules, framed by the Speaker of the Assembly under paragraph 8 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution, the High Court was clearly wrong in interpreting the said provisions so as to allow an application for disqualification of a Member of the House to be made by a person who was not a Member thereof. Mr. Venugopal submitted that the Order of the High Court was contrary to the provisions of law and was liable to be set aside.
11. On the other hand, Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned Senior Advocate, who appeared for the sole Respondent who had made the application for disqualification of the four Members before the Speaker, submitted that the four MLAs who had been elected on the nomination of the NCP, joined the Biju Janata Dal on 5.6.2012, without giving any prior notice of their intention to do so and that they had voluntarily given up the membership of the NCP by joining the BJD, thereby incurring disqualification as Members of the Assembly under paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule to theConstitution.
12. Mr. Sharan also submitted that the action of the said four MLAs did not amount to a merger of the NCP Legislature Party with the Biju Janata Dal on account of the fact that a merger could only be of a political party with any other political party. Mr. Sharan submitted that the legislature party of a political party by itself had no authority or power to merge with any other political party, without the merger of its original political party.
In such circumstances, the provisions of paragraph 2(1)(a)of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution were squarely attracted to the facts of this case and the same had merely to be brought to the notice of the Speaker for him to hold that the said four MLAs stood disqualified from the membership of the House.
13. On the question of the locus standi of the Respondent to maintain the writ petition in his capacity as the President of the State unit of the NCP in the State of Orissa, Mr. Sharan submitted that the said question was no longer res integra in view of the decision rendered by this Court in the case of Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh (supra), in which reference had been made to a Full Bench decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Prakash Singh Badal (supra).
Mr. Sharan submitted that the Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court had considered the question, which has also arisen in this case, and it had held that paragraph (2)(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule did not contemplate or visualize that the disqualification incurred by a Member of the House would have to be brought to the notice of the Speaker only by a Member of the House. Mr. Sharan submitted that the Full Bench had also indicated that in relation to paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule, the only prerequisite is the existence of a question of disqualification of a Member. Such a question could be raised before the Speaker by an interested person for declaring that the said Member stood disqualified from being a Member of the House.
It was in that context that in the instant case the Speaker had held that when any Member belonging to a political party joined another political party, which amounted to disqualification under paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule, any person interested could make a reference to the Speaker under Rule 6and it was not necessary that such reference would have to be made only by a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Sharan submitted, that as indicated by this Court in Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh's case, as President, NCP, the Respondent had the locus standi to maintain his application, both before the Speaker, as well as before the High Court.
14. Mr. Sharan submitted that any other interpretation given to the provisions of paragraph 2(1)(a) read with Rule 6 (1) and (2) of the 1987Rules, would defeat the very object and purpose of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution.
15. On a consideration of the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are unable to agree with the interpretation sought to be given by Mr. Venugopal to the provisions of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules read with paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution on the question of locus standi of the Respondent, as the President of the State unit of the National Congress Party in the State of Orissa, to file the application seeking disqualification of the four Members of the National Congress Party who had switched their loyalties to the Biju JanataDal.
16. Although, paragraph 8 of the Tenth Schedule vests the Speaker of the House with powers to make rules for giving effect to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, the Rules framed under such powers would amount to delegated legislation which cannot override the substantive provisions of the Constitution contained in the Schedule itself. The provisions of Sub-Rules (1) and (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules cannot override the provisions of paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution or for that matter, paragraph 6 which vests the Speaker of the House with the authority to decide the question as to whether a Member of a House had become subject to disqualification under the Schedule. Although, Rule 6(2)of the 1987 Rules provides that a petition in relation to a Member for the purposes of Sub-Rule (1) may be made in writing to the Speaker by any other Member, such a provision is neither contemplated nor provided for in the Tenth Schedule itself.
As has been submitted by Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned Senior Advocate for the Respondent, in a case such as this, where all the four Members elected to the Assembly from the National Congress Party had changed their allegiance from the National Congress Party to the Biju Janata Dal, there would be no one to bring such fact to the notice of the Speaker and ask for disqualification of the said Members who clearly stood disqualified under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. In other words, although, disqualified under paragraph 2(1)(a) of the Tenth Schedule, in the absence of any application for disqualification to the Speaker, they would continue to function as Members of the Assembly, which was not the intent of or the object sought to be achieved by the 52ndAmendment by which the Tenth Schedule was introduced in the Constitution.
17. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill, which finally became the Constitution (52nd Amendment) Act, 1985, whereby the Tenth Schedule was added to the Constitution with effect from 1st March, 1985,inter alia, indicated that the evil of political defection had become a matter of national concern and if it was not checked, it could very well undermine the very foundation of our democracy and the principles which sustain the same. In such event, if the provisions of the Tenth Schedule are interpreted to exclude the right of any person interested to bring to the notice of the Speaker of the House the fact that any or some of its Members had incurred disqualification from the membership of the House on any of the eventualities indicated in paragraphs 2 and 4 therein, it would render the inclusion of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution otiose and defeat the objects and intent of the 52nd Amendment of the Constitution.
18. The conundrum presented on account of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule in addition to Rules 6(1) and (2) of the 1987 Rules had fallen for consideration in Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh's case (supra). Speaking for the Bench, G.P. Mathur, J. (as His Lordship then was), observed in paragraph 16 of the judgment that the purpose and object of the Rules framed by the Chairman in exercise of power conferred by paragraph 8 of the Tenth Schedule was to facilitate the Chairman in discharging his duties and responsibilities in resolving any dispute as to whether the Member of the House had become subject to disqualification under the Tenth Schedule. It was also observed that the Rules being in the domain of procedure, were intended to facilitate the holding of an inquiry and not to frustrate or obstruct the same by the introduction of innumerable technicalities. Being subordinate legislation, the Rules could not make any provision which could have the effect of curtailing the content and scope of the substantive provision, namely, the Tenth Schedule.
19. The aforesaid observation is precisely what we too have in mind, as otherwise, the very object of the introduction of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution would be rendered meaningless. The provisions of Sub-rules (1) and (2) of Rule 6 of the 1987 Rules have, therefore, to be read down to make it clear that not only a Member of the House, but any person interested, would also be entitled to bring to the notice of the Speaker the fact that a Member of the House had incurred disqualification under the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India. On receipt of such information, the Speaker of the House would be entitled to decide under paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule as to whether the Member concerned had, in fact, incurred such disqualification and to pass appropriate orders on his findings.
20. We, accordingly, dismiss all the appeals and uphold the judgment of the High Court impugned therein.
21. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
",1
"1. Leave granted.
2. The present appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 26th July, 2010 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in LPA No. 865 of 2010 whereby the Division Bench concurred with the view expressed by the learned single Judge in CWP No.1383 of 2009 where under the respondents were held entitled for grant of Assured Career Progression Scale (for short ""the ACP Scale"") on completion of ten years of service which included training as apprentice.
3. The facts as have been undraped are that the three respondents invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court claiming the benefit of the second ACP Scale on completion of twenty years of service on the base that their period of training as apprentice had to be taken into consideration. Such a claim was founded on the assertion that they had joined as trainees between 17.4.1987 to 30.4.1987 and were subsequently absorbed and brought into the cadre. On completion of ten years from the date they entered the service as trainees, the first ACP Scale was granted to them. However, when conferring of the benefit of the second ACP Scale arose, the same was not extended to them.
The said action of the employer compelled them to knock at the doors of the High Court and during the pendency of the writ petition, by proceeding dated 23.4.2009, the benefits conferred under the first ACP Scale was withdrawn referring to a notification issued on11.3.1990 which stipulated in clause (4) that the trainees referred to therein would be entitled to increment only on successful completion of their training and in case of Plant Attendant Grade-II and Technician Grade-II, increment on successful completion of training would be granted but without arrears.
Though the writ petition was confined to grant of the second ACP Scale, yet the learned single Judge required the counsel for both the sides to address about the justifiability of withdrawal of the benefit of the first ACP Scale and decided both the facets. The said exercise was undertaken by the learned single Judge as the primal issue in respect of both the ACP Scales rested on the question whether the period spent during training could be counted towards regular satisfactory service or not.
4. It is not in dispute that the respondents were appointed as Apprentice ITI Trainees by the erstwhile Haryana State Electricity Board(for short ""the Board"") for a period of two years on fixed pay of Rs.350/-per month in 1987. The Board, vide Office Order No. 706/Finance dated 27.2.1998, set out the eligibility criteria for conferment of benefit of the ACP Scales. There is no dispute that the respondents, who were Technicians Grade-II, were not excluded from the application of the same. The only question that really emerged for consideration before the learned single Judge as well as by the Division Bench was the relevant date from which the regular satisfactory service was to be computed for grant of ACP Scales.
The learned single Judge, after referring to the clause and the communications issued by the Board from time to time, came to hold that the regular satisfactory service would include the period spent by the persons as trainees. As regards the withdrawal of the first ACP Scale, the learned single Judge, referring to the notification dated 14.3.1990 and especially to clause (4) which dealt with grant of increment and thereafter applying the same reasoning, came to hold that clause (4) would have no operation to override the Office Order dated 27.2.1998 which provides how the regular satisfactory service could be reckoned and, eventually, came to hold that the ACP Scale that had been withdrawn during the pendency of the writ petition was absolutely erroneous.
Being of this view, he quashed the withdrawal order and issued a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents therein to grant both the first and second ACP Scales reckoning the period of training towards the regular satisfactory service.
5. In the Letters Patent Appeal, the Division Bench analysed the anatomy of clause 3(q) dealing with grant of the second ACP Scale and the eligibility criteria, placed reliance on the memorandum dated 27.3.1991circulated to all the departments to the effect that the period of training of all employees should be treated as duty for all intents and purposes, referred to the memo dated 2.1.1992 which stated that the period of training shall be treated as duty for all intents and purposes, i.e., seniority, leave, etc. and for experience in service for the purpose of promotion and further relying on the memorandum dated 20.1.1992 which has laid down that such period would be counted as experience in service for the purposes of promotion, concurred with the opinion expressed by the learned single Judge and declined to entertain the appeal. Hence, the present appeal by the appellants.
6. We have heard Mr. Shivendra Dwivedi, learned counsel for the appellants, and Mr. R.K. Kapoor, learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
7. At the very outset, we may note that the respondents were granted the first ACP Scale on 16.6.1997, 13.1.1999 and 30.6.1998 with effect from1.5.1997 instead of 1.11.1998 as on that date, they completed ten years of service. The same was withdrawn during the pendency of the writ petition where the grievance pertained to non-grant of the second ACP Scale in terms of the Scheme dated 27.2.1998 introduced by the Board. It is also apt to note here that the respondents have already been granted second ACP Scale with effect from 1.11.2008. Thus, the only grievance is that the period shall differ in respect of each respondent if the training period is not computed.
8. In the backdrop of the aforesaid narrow controversy, we think it apposite to scrutinize the various documents brought on record and how they are to be understood, appreciated and interpreted regard being had to the contextual meaning of the term 'training'.
9. The respondent No. 1 was appointed as Apprentice ITI Trainee vide letter dated 28.3.1987 by the Board. It was stipulated in the said letter that during the period of training, he would get a fixed pay of Rs.350/-per month and on successful completion of the training, he may be appointed as Plant Attendant Grade-II/Technician Grade-II in the scale of Rs.400-700on temporary basis and he would be exclusively posted in the Thermal Organisation. It was also stipulated therein that he would enter into an agreement with the Board that he would serve the Board for at least five years after successful completion of training and in case he would leave the service of the Board, he would remit the entire cost incurred by the Board in connection with the training during the period and thereafter during the course of his appointment together with interest.
Similar letter was issued to the other respondents. Vide Office Order No.303/EOM/G-263 dated 6.6.1989, number of persons including the respondents were appointed as Officiating Technicians Grade-II in the pay-scale of 950-20-1150-ED-25-1500 with effect from the dates mentioned against their names. The respondents were appointed on regular basis with effect from30.10.1988, 17.10.1988 and 25.10.1988 respectively with the stipulation that they would remain on probation for a period of two years.
10. As the factual narration would exposit, the Board, in exercise of power under Section 79 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, issued a notification on 14.3.1990 by bringing certain amendments in the recruitment and promotion for employees working in Thermal Power Projects. The relevant part of the amendment reads as follows: - ""Para 3(i) of Part-A shall be substituted and read as follows: 50% posts shall be filled-up by direct recruitment from amongst persons having passed 2 years ITI Course with Matric as minimum qualification.
Such directly recruited Plant attendant Gr-II shall remain on training for a period of two years in regular pay scale of Plant Attendant Gr-II to be allowed by the Board from time to time. The Competent Authority may terminate the services of a Plant Attendant Gr-II (Trainee) without notice and without assigning any reason, if his work and conduct during the period of training is not found satisfactory."" ""Para-3 (i) of Part-B shall be substituted and read as follows: 50% posts shall be filled-up by direct recruitment from amongst persons having passed 2 years ITI Course with Middle examination with 2 years experience or ITI one year course and Middle Examination and with 3 years experience on similar works.
Such directly recruitment Technician Gr-II shall remain on training for a period of two years in the regular pay scale to be allowed by the Board from time to time. The Competent Authority may terminate the services of a Technician Gr-II (Trainee) without notice and without assigning any reason, if his work and conduct during period of training, is not found satisfactory. The trainees referred to above shall be entitled to the increment only on successful completion of their training. In case of Plant attendant Gr-II and Technician Gr-II, increment on successful completion of training shall be granted, but without arrears."" [underlining is ours]
11. We have referred to the substituted clauses in extenso to appreciate the use of the word 'training' therein after appointment to a post and the stipulation relating to the grant of increment. In the context of this notification, the policy relating to ACP Scale granted under the ACP Scheme and the clarificatory communications are to be understood.
12. Coming back to the narration, recruitment and promotion policy as amended, the F.A. & C.A.O., PTPS, HSE, Panipat, vide Memo dated 7.12.1990sought certain clarification in relation to grant of increments. The clarification sought was to the following effect: - ""In this connection it may please be clarified whether the period of training in all the cases will count towards increment, leave salary and pension. The above clarification may please be issued at the earliest so that the cases are dealt with accordingly on account of grant of increment and leave salary etc.
13. ""On 27.3.1991, the Secretary, HSEB, clarified the position by stating as follows: - ""Board vide its notification No. 57, 58, 59, 60/Reg-137, dated 14.03.1990 and Notification No. 76/Reg-39/L, dated 13.09.90 have granted regular pay scales to the trainee(s) of all categories w.e.f. 29.1.1990. In this respect the Field Officers have sought for a clarification whether the period spent by the trainee on training is to be treated as duty for all intents and purposes or not. After considering the pros and cons of the case, it has been decided that the period spent by the trainee(s) of all categories on training shall be treated as duty for all intents and purposes i.e. grant of increment in accordance with the provisions as contained in the Policy, leave and seniority i.e. from the date of joining in this cadre.""
[emphasis supplied]
14. In continuation of the aforesaid clarificatory memorandum dated27.3.1991, the Board issued another memorandum on 22.11.1991. The said clarification related to grant of regular pay scale to the trainees of all categories and in that letter, it has been stated as follows: - ""In this connection, it is stated that some field offices have sought for a clarification as to whether the benefit for the grant of annual increment under the provisions as contained in letter dated 27.3.91 is to be given to all trainee(s), who were appointed during the year, 1987, 1988 & 1989 etc.
15. ""After referring to the issue which required clarification, the Board clarified that it has decided that monetary benefits of regular pay scale had to be granted to the trainee(s) of all categories with effect from 29.1.1990 but the benefit of grant of annual increment under the provisions as contained in letter dated 27.3.1991 has to be given to the trainee(s) of all categories whose services have been regularized on 29.1.1991 or thereafter. It had been further stated that the consequential benefits would accrue only from the date on which the regular pay scale has been granted to the trainees of all categories.
16. As the facts have been further un curtained, on 27.1.1998, the Board introduced the Assured Career Progression Scheme (for short ""the ACP Scheme"") with the objective to provide such Board employees who fall within the scope of the Scheme at least two financial up gradations including the financial up gradation, if any, availed by such Board employees as a consequence of the functional promotion. Clause 2 excludes certain categories of employees, namely, appointed on ad hoc basis, work charged basis, part time paid out of contingencies and a daily wager from getting the benefit of the Scheme. Clause 3 deals with the definitions.
It defines in Clause 3(b) ""direct recruit fresh entrant"". The same, being relevant, is reproduced below: - ""(b) ""Direct Recruited Fresh Entrant"" with reference to a post or a Board Employee means the post on which such Board employee was recruited as a regular and direct recruitee in the Board service and is in continuous employment of Board since such recruitment;
17. ""Clause 5 deals with the eligibility for grant of ACP Scales. That being the thrust of the controversy the relevant part of the said clause is reproduced below:
""5. Eligibility for Grant of ACP Scales:
(1) Every Board employee who, after a regular satisfactory service for a minimum period of 10 years, has not got any financial upgradation in terms of grant of a pay scale higher than the functional pay scale prescribed for the post as on 31.12.1995, on which he was recruited as direct recruited fresh entrant: -
(a) either as a consequence of his functional promotion in the hierarchy, or
(b) as a consequence of the revision of pay scale for the same post, or
(c) as a consequence of any other event through which the functional pay scale of the post has been upgraded, with respect to the functional pay scale prescribed for the post as on 31.12.1995, shall for the purposes of drawal of pay; be eligible for placement into the First ACP scale with reference to him.
(2) Every Board employee who, after a regular satisfactory service for a minimum period of 20 years, has not got more than one financial upgradation in terms of grant of pay scale higher than the functional pay scale prescribed for the post as on 31.12.1995 on which he was recruited as a direct recruited fresh entrant: -
(a) either as a consequence of his functional promotion in the hierarchy, or
(b) as a consequence of the revision of pay scale for the same post, or
(c) as a consequences of any other event through which the functional pay scale of the post has been upgraded, with respect to the functional pay scale prescribed for the post as on 31.12.1995, shall for the purposes of drawal of pay; be eligible for placement into the First ACP scale with reference to him. Provided that grant of ACP scale shall also be considered financial upgradation for the purpose of this para.
NOTE : For the purposes of this scheme regular satisfactory service would mean continuous service counting towards seniority under H.S.E.B. including continuous service in P.S.E.B. before reorganization, commencing from the date on which the board employee joined his service after being recruited through the prescribed procedure or rules regulations etc. for regular recruitment, in the cadre in which he is working at the time of being considered his eligibility for grant of ACP scales under this scheme and further fulfilling all the recruitments prescribed for determining the suitability of grant of ACP scales. The period spent on ad hoc basis; work charged basis; contingent basis and daily wages will not be counted for the purpose of counting of prescribed length of ""Regular Satisfactory Service"" for this scheme.""
[emphasis supplied]
18. In this backdrop, it is to be seen whether the period spent in apprenticeship would be counted towards regular satisfactory service. The learned single Judge as well as the Division Bench has returned a finding in favour of the respondents solely on the basis of the clarificatory letters and communications. Before we advert to the quintessential tenor of the said communications, it is necessitous to understand the nature of appointment, the concept of an apprentice, his rights under the law and the basic ingredients of regular satisfactory service.
19. As has been stated earlier, the respondents were appointed as apprentices ITI trainee for a period of two years. Each of them were paid a fixed salary of Rs.350/-. After completion of the training, it was mentioned in the letter of appointment that they may be appointed to the post of Officiating Technical Grade-II in the pay scale of Rs.400/700 on temporary basis.
20. Section 2(aa) of the Apprentices Act, 1961 (for short ""the 1961 Act"")defines ""apprentice"" which means a person who is undergoing apprenticeship training in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship.
21. Section 2(aaa) defines ""apprenticeship training"" which means a course of training in any industry or establishment undergone in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship and under prescribed terms and conditions which may be different for different categories of apprentices. Section 18clearly states that apprentices are trainees and not workers.
22. In U.P. State Electricity Board v. Shiv Mohan Singh and Another[1],A.K. Mathur, J., speaking for Hegde, J. and himself, while dealing with the status of apprentice, has stated thus: - ""Therefore a combined reading of the sections as well as Rules makes it clear that apprentices are only persons undergoing training and during that training they are entitled to get a particular stipend, they have to work for fixed hours and at the end of period of training they have to appear in the test and a certificate is issued to them.
There is no obligation on the part of the employer to give them any employment whatsoever. The position of the apprentice remains as an apprentice trainee and during the period of training they will not be treated as workmen. Only obligation on the part of the employer is to impart them training as per provisions of the Act and Rules and to pay them stipend as required under Rule 11 and beyond that there is no obligation on the part of the employer to accept them as his employees and give them the status of workmen. There is no relation of master and servant or employer and employee.
23. ""Be it noted, in the said case, in paragraph 51, it has been laid down that the 1961 Act is a complete code in itself and it lays down the conditions of the apprentices, their tenure, their terms and conditions and their obligations and what are the obligations of the employer. It also lays down that the apprentices are trainees and not workmen and if any dispute arises, then the settlement has to be made by the Apprenticeship Advisor as per Section 20 of the Apprentices Act, 1961 and his decision thereof is final.
The nature and character of the apprentice is nothing but that of a trainee and he is supposed to enter into a contract and by virtue of that contract, he is to serve for a fixed period on a fixed stipend and that does not change the character of the apprentice to that of a workman under the employer where he is undergoing the apprenticeship training. Sub-section (4) of Section 4 only lays down that such contract should be registered with the Apprenticeship Adviser, but by non-registration of the contract, the position of the apprentice is not changed to that of a workman. From the scheme of the Act, the apprentice is recruited for the purpose of training as defined in Section 2(aa) of the Apprentices Act, 1961 and from the language employed in Sections 6 and 7, it is more than clear that the nature and character of the apprentice is that of a trainee only and on the expiry of the training, there is no corresponding obligation on the part of the employer to employ him.
24. Thereafter, the majority, referring to Section 22 of the Act, opined as follows: - ""Section 22 makes it abundantly clear that at the end of the apprenticeship training, it is not obligatory on the part of the employer to offer an employment to an apprentice who has completed the period of apprenticeship. It is only if the terms of the contract of the apprenticeship lay down a condition that on successful completion of an apprenticeship training, an employer will offer him an employment then it is obligatory on the part of the employer to do so. If there is no such condition stipulated in the apprenticeship contract then the employer cannot be compelled to offer employment to such apprentice.
At the same time, it is not obligatory on the part of the apprentice to serve that employer if there is no such stipulation to this effect. So it is a mutual thing and it depends on the terms of contract. The survey of all these provisions of the Acts and the Rules as mentioned above, makes it clear that the character and status of apprentice remains the same and he does not become workman and labour laws are not attracted."" S.B. Sinha, J., in his concurring opinion, has stated thus: - ""Moreover in terms of Section 22 of the Act, the employer has no statutory liability to give employment to an apprentice.
25. ""In Narinder Kumar and Others v. The State of Punjab and Others[2], a two-Judge Bench dwelt upon the letter of appointment of apprentices and came to hold that the employer was bound to appoint the apprentices in the available vacancies because of Section 22(2) of the 1961 Act and the contractual obligations arising out of para 2 of the letter of appointment which stated that the apprentices shall be absorbed in the department if there are vacancies. Be it noted, emphasis was laid on the nature of the contract.
26. In Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Bhola Singh[3], while dealing with anaward passed by the Labour Court under the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act relating to apprentices, a two-Judge Bench opined thus: - ""14. If the respondent was appointed in terms of the Apprentices Act, 1961, he will not be a workman, as has been held by this Court in Mukesh K. Tripathi v. Senior Divisional Manager, LIC[4] and U.P. SEB v. Shiv Mohan Singh (supra). 15. In terms of the provisions of the Apprentices Act, 1961, a trainee or an apprentice has no right to be absorbed in services.
27. ""We have referred to the aforesaid pronouncements solely for the purpose that an apprentice does not have a statutory right to claim an appointment and the employer is not under any statutory obligation to give him employment. However, if the terms of the contract of apprenticeship lay down a condition that on successful completion of apprenticeship an employer would offer him an employment, then it is obligatory on his part to do so. In the absence of such a condition, there is no obligation. It depends on the terms of the contract. In the case at hand, as the letter of appointment would show, the employer had only stated that on successful completion of the training, the apprentice may be appointed as Plant Attendant/Technician Grade-II. Thus, it was not a mandatory term incorporated in the agreement casting an obligation on the employer to appoint him.
28. Having dealt with the rights of an apprentice, we may presently proceed to dwell upon the issue whether any of the clarificatory letters/circulars conferred any benefit on these employees so that they could be treated to be in regular service. On a perusal of the notification issued by the Board, it is clear as crystal that it relates to two categories of direct recruits who shall undergo training for a period of two years in the regular pay scale. Thus, the said notification has no application to apprentices who avail the training. In the clarification issued on 27.3.1991, there is a mention with regard to the regular pay scale in the notification dated 13.9.1990.
The query was limited to the issue whether the training period of such a trainee would be counted for all intents and purposes or not. In that context, it was clarified that the period spent by the apprentice of all categories shall be treated as duty for all intents and purposes, i.e., for grant of increment in accordance with the provisions as contained in the policy, leave and seniority, i.e., from the date of joining in this cadre. It is worth noting that the Board had issued further clarification that the benefit of grant of annual increment under the provisions as contained in the letter dated 27.3.1991 was to be given to the trainees of all categories whose services had been regularized on 29.1.1991 or thereafter, and the consequential benefit should accrue only from the date on which the regular pay scale has been granted to the trainees of all categories.
Clause 5 of the ACP Scheme which provides for eligibility criteria, in its note stipulates that for the purpose of the scheme, regular satisfactory service would mean continuous service counting towards seniority under the Board including the continuous service in PSEB before reorganization. It has been clearly stated that period spent on ad hoc basis, work charged basis, contingent basis and daily wages would not be counted for the purpose of counting the prescribed length of regular satisfactory service for the scheme. The respondents, as is evident, were appointed on different dates, i.e., 30.10.1988, 17.10.1988 and 25.10.1988 respectively as Technicians Grade-II in the pay scale on regular basis. Their period of probation was for two years.
The letter/circular dated 27.3.1991 emphasizes the terms from the date of joining in the cadre. As is perceptible from the clarificatory letter dated 27.3.1991, the trainees of all categories have been granted regular pay scale from 21.1.1990 and decision had been taken that the training period or period spent as trainees of all categories shall be treated as duty for all intents and purposes. On 20th of January, 1992, it was further clarified that the period spent by the trainees of all categories on training would be counted as experience in service for the purposes of promotion. On a scrutiny of the promotion policy, the ACP Scheme and the communications, we find that the High Court has erred in its appreciation of the contents of the promotion policy and the conditions incorporated in the scheme and the clarificatory letters issued from time to time and their essential purport.
The Board, on 14.3.1990, substituted and added certain clauses to the recruitment and promotion policy. We have reproduced the same earlier and on a proper scrutiny, it is perceivable that 50% posts are to be filled by direct recruitment from amongst persons who have passed 2 years ITI course with Matric as minimum qualification and such directly recruited Plant Attendants Grade-II would remain on training for a period of two years on the regular pay scale of Plant Attendant Grade-II to be allowed by the Board from time to time, and the other 50% is be filled up by direct recruitment from amongst persons who have passed two years ITI course with middle examination with two years experience or ITI one year course with middle examination and with three years experience of similar works.
Such directly recruited Technician Grade-II shall remain on training for a period of two years in the regular pay scale. The clarificatory letter has to be read in the said context and we are disposed to think so as the persons appointed under the policy in the regular pay scale are required to go on training. The clarification sought related to grant of increment and computation of period that is spent as trainee in the capacity of Plant Attendant Grade-II and in that context, the clarification issued was that the training of all categories on training would be counted. It is worthy to note that the respondents were not recruited under the said policy.
They were appointed as apprentices ITI trainee on 28.3.1987 and they were not given any kind of post. It is only mentioned that they may be appointed as Plant Attendant Grade- II/Technician Grade-II. Thereafter, they were appointed on different dates as Officiating Technician Grade-II. The regular pay scale was given from the date of appointment. Prior to that, it was a fixed pay. They were not working on a post. They did not belong to any cadre. In fact, they were not recruited and, hence, the term trainee which has been referred to in various clarificatory letters has been misconstrued by the High Court.
29. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we conclude and hold that the judgments rendered by the learned single Judge as well as by the Division Bench are unsustainable and are, accordingly, set aside. However, we clarify that if any financial benefit had been availed by the respondents, the same shall not be recovered, but their dates for grant of ACP Scale shall remain as determined by the appellants. Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of. The parties shall bear their respective costs.

"1. These appeals have been preferred against the judgments and orders of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Special Civil Application No. 12632 of 2011, dated 10.10.2011 and 18.1.2012.
2. The facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are as under:
A. The legislature of Gujarat enacted the Gujarat Lokayukta Act 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the, 'Act, 1986'), which provided for the appointment of a Lokayukta, who must be a retired Judge of the High Court. The said statute, was given effect to, and various Lokayuktas were appointed over time, by following the procedure prescribed under the Act, 1986, for the said purpose, i.e., the Chief Minister of Gujarat, upon consultation with the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court, and the Leader of Opposition in the House, would make a recommendation to the Governor, on the basis of which, the Governor would then issue requisite letters of appointment.
B. The post of the Lokayukta became vacant on 24.11.2003, upon the resignation of Justice S.M. Soni. The Chief Minister, after the expiry of about three years, wrote a letter dated 1.8.2006 to the Chief Justice, suggesting the name of Justice K.R. Vyas for appointment to the post of Lokayukta. The name of Justice K.R. Vyas was approved by the Chief Justice, vide letter dated 7.8.2006, and the Chief Minister, after completing other required formalities, forwarded the said name, to the Governor on 10.8.2006, seeking his approval, as regards appointment. The file remained pending for a period of 3 years, and was returned on 10.9.2009, as Justice K.R. Vyas had been appointed as Chairman of the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission, on 21.8.2007.
C. On 29.12.2009, Private Secretary, to the Governor of Gujarat, addressed a letter to the Registrar General of the High Court of Gujarat, requesting that a panel of names be suggested by the Chief Justice, so that the same could be considered by the Governor, with respect to their possible appointment, to the post of Lokayukta.
D. The Chief Minister, also wrote a letter dated 8.2.2010, to the Chief Justice, requesting him to send a panel of names of three retired Judges for the purpose of consideration of one of them to be finally appointed as Lokayukta. The Chief Justice, vide letter dated 24.2.2010, suggested the names of four retired Judges, taking care to stipulate that the said names were not arranged in any order of preference, and that any one of them, could thus, be chosen by the Governor.
E. The Chief Minister after receiving the aforementioned letter, made an attempt to consult the Leader of Opposition, regarding the said names by writing a letter dated 2.3.2010, who vide letter dated 3.3.2010, was of the opinion that under the Act, 1986 the Chief Minister, had no right to embark upon any consultation, with respect to the appointment of the Lokayukta. There was some further correspondence of a similar nature between them on this issue.
F. The Leader of Opposition, vide letter dated 4.3.2010, pointed out to the Chief Minister, that the process of consultation regarding the appointment of the Lokayukta, had already been initiated by the Governor directly, and thus, the Chief Minister should not attempt to interfere with the same. The Leader of Opposition did not attend any meeting held in this regard, and the Governor also did not think it proper to indulge in any further consultation with the Chief Minister with respect to the said issue.
G. In the meantime, as has been mentioned above, not only were the meetings called by the Chief Minister, not attended by the Leader of Opposition, but it also appears that simultaneously, the Council of Ministers had already considered the names as recommended by the Chief Justice, and vide letter dated 24.2.2010, had proceeded to approve the name of Justice J.R. Vora (Retd.), for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, and the file was sent to the Governor for approval and consequential appointment. However, no orders were passed by the Governor.
H. The Governor instead sought the opinion of the Attorney General of India, as regards the nature of the process of consultation, required to be adopted in the matter of appointment of the Lokayukta. The Governor also addressed a letter to the Chief Justice dated 23.4.2010, soliciting his opinion as to who would be a better choice for appointment to the post of Lokayukta, between Justice R.P. Dholakia (Retd.), who was the President of the Gujarat Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and Justice J.R. Vora (Retd.), from among the panel of names that had been sent by the Chief Justice, vide letter dated 24.2.2010.
I. The Attorney General in his opinion dated 23.4.2010, stated that the Chief Justice ought to have suggested only one name, and that he could not have required to recommend a panel of names. The Chief Justice on 27.4.2010, wrote to the Governor stating that, in his opinion, Justice R.P. Dholakia (Retd.) would be the more appropriate choice. However, despite this, the Governor did not issue a letter of appointment to anyone, and requested the Chief Justice vide letter dated 3.5.2010, to recommend only one name, as opined by the Attorney General, vide his letter dated 23.4.2010.
J. In response to the suggestion made by the Governor, the Chief Justice wrote to the Governor on 29.12.2010, recommending the name of Justice S.D. Dave (Retd.), for appointment to the post of Lokayukta. The Chief Justice also wrote a letter to the Chief Minister on 31.12.2010, recommending the name of Justice S.D. Dave, in place of that of Justice J.R. Vora, as Justice J.R. Vora had already been appointed elsewhere.
K. The Chief Minister wrote a letter dated 21.2.2011, to the Chief Justice by way of which, he re-iterated the request of the State Government, to appoint Justice J.R. Vora as Lokayukta, owing to the fact that the process of consultation was already complete and further that, Justice J.R. Vora had expressed his willingness to accept his appointment to the post of Lokayukta, if the same was offered to him, and in this regard, the Chief Minister even wrote a second letter, dated 4.5.2011, to the Chief Justice, requesting him to reconsider the said issue.
L. The Chief Justice, vide letter dated 7.6.2011, made a suggestion to the Governor to the effect that, Justice R.A. Mehta (Retd.) be appointed as Lokayukta, and the said recommendation was also sent by the Chief Justice, to the Chief Minister. The Governor, on the same day, i.e. 7.6.2011, requested the Chief Minister to expedite the process for the appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta, as Lokayukta.
M. The Chief Minister, vide letter dated 16.6.2011, requested the Chief Justice to consider certain objections raised by him against the appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta as Lokayukta, which included among other things, the fact that Justice R.A. Mehta was above 75 years of age, as also his association with NGOs and social activist groups, known for their antagonism against the State Government; and further, that he possessed a specific biased disposition, against the Government. To support the apprehensions raised by him, the Chief Minister annexed along with his letter, 11 clippings of newspaper.
N. The Chief Justice, vide letter dated 2.8.2011, replied to the aforementioned letter of the Chief Minister, pointing out that Justice R.A. Mehta was not ineligible for appointment to the post of Lokayukta on the basis of any of the points raised by the Chief Minister, and that he was a man of great repute and high integrity. Justice R.A. Mehta had never made any public statement detrimental to the society as a whole, nor had he ever shown any bias either with respect to, or against any government, and finally, that he was not a member of any NGO. Even otherwise, membership of a person of an NGO, or his social activities, cannot be treated as a basis for his disqualification, for being appointed to the post of Lokayukta.
O. The Governor, vide letter dated 16.8.2011, requested the Chief Minister to process the appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta as Lokayukta. The Leader of Opposition also wrote a letter dated 16.8.2011, to the Chief Minister, informing him of the fact that he had already been consulted by the Governor, as regards the said issue, and that in connection with the same, he had agreed to the appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta as Lokayukta. At this juncture, the Governor issued the requisite warrant from her office on 25.8.2011, appointing Justice R.A. Mehta as Lokayukta.
P. The Gujarat Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2011 was passed by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Gujarat on 30.3.2011, which primarily sought to widen the definition of the term, ""public functionaries"", contained in Section 2(7) of the Act, 1986, by including a large number of other functionaries, within its purview, such as Mayors, Deputy Mayors of the Municipal Corporation, the President or the Vice-President of Municipalities, the Sarpanch and Up- Sarpanch of Village Panchayats etc. The Governor returned the said Bill for reconsideration, as she realised that the Lokayukta, however competent and efficient he may be, would be unable to look into complaints of irregularities made against such a large number of persons.
Q. The Governor also refused to issue an Ordinance to amend the Act, 1986, wherein Section 3 was to be amended, which would have changed the composition of the consultees as contemplated under the Act, 1986, for the purpose of deciding upon the appointment of the Lokayukta, on the ground that there was no grave urgency for bringing in such an Ordinance, all of a sudden.
R. The State of Gujarat filed writ petition No. 12632 of 2011 dated 5.9.2011, in the High Court of Gujarat, challenging the appointment of Justice R.A. Mehta to the post of Lokayukta. The matter was decided vide judgment and order dated 10.10.2011, wherein the two Judges while hearing the case differed in their views to a certain extent. Accordingly, the matter was then referred to a third Judge, who delivered his judgment dated 18.1.2012, dismissing the said writ petition. Hence, these appeals.
RIVAL CONTENTIONS:
3. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, Mr. Soli Sorabjee, Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. Mihir J. Thakore, and Mr. Yatin Oza, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, have submitted that the Governor, being a titular head of State, is bound to act only in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister, and that the actions of the Governor, indulging in correspondence with, and issuing directions to other statutory authorities, are contrary to the principles of Parliamentary democracy, and thus, the Governor ought not to have corresponded with, and consulted the Chief Justice of the High Court of Gujarat directly.
It was also contended that, the Chief Justice ought to have recommended, a panel of names for consideration by the other consultees, i.e., the Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition, and that he could not recommend only one name, as the same would cause the entire process to fall within the ambit of concurrence, rather than that of consultation. Furthermore, consultation by the Governor with the Attorney General of India, who is alien to the Act, 1986, runs contrary to the statutory provisions of the said Act. The Governor is not acting merely as a statutory authority, but as the Head of the State, and hence, the entire procedure adopted by her is in clear contravention of the actual procedure, contemplated by the statute, for the purpose of selection of the Lokayukta.
The Chief Justice ought to have taken into consideration, the objections raised by the appellants, qua the recommendation made by the Chief Justice with respect to the appointment of respondent no. 1. The third Hon'ble Judge made unwarranted and uncalled for remarks in carping language in connection with the Chief Minister which tantamount to resounding strictures, and the same require to be expunged. Thus, the appeals deserve to be allowed and the majority judgments (impugned), set aside.
4. Per contra, Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned Solicitor General of India, Mr. P.P.Rao, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, and Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, have opposed the appeals, contending that the Governor had acted as a statutory authority under the Act, 1986, and not as the head of the State, and thus, she was not required to act in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, no fault can be found with the procedure adopted by the Governor, as the objections raised by the Chief Minister were thoroughly considered by the Chief Justice, and no substance was found therein.
The Chief Justice has primacy of opinion in the matter of consultation, and therefore, the sending of a panel of names instead of just one name, does not amount to a violation of the scheme of the Act. A perusal of the statute and the sequence of events herein, makes it crystal clear, that the Governor acted in correct perspective, and that no fault can be found with the selection of respondent no. 1 to the post of Lokayukta. The appellants have in fact, been avoiding the appointment of a Lokayukta for a period of more than nine years, for which there can be no justification. The harsh language used by the 3rd Judge was warranted because of the defiant attitude adopted by the Chief Minister which was appalling, and thus, the remarks do not need to be expunged. The appeals hence, lack merit and are liable to be dismissed.
5. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. These appeals raise legal issues of great public importance, such as, what is the meaning of the term 'consultation' contained in Section 3 of the Act, 1986, and also whether the opinion of the Chief Justice has primacy with respect to the appointment of the Lokayukta. The twin issues of consultation vis-? -vis concurrence and primacy, have been debated extensively before this Court and answered by larger benches while interpreting Article 124(2) of the Constitution in matters relating to appointment of Judges of Supreme Court and High Court. The present case also involves the determination of the meaning of the word ""consultation"" in Section 3 of the Act, 1986 in the said context. However, a two-Judges bench in the case of Suraz Trust India v. Union of India & Anr., (2011) 4 SCALE 252, has entertained the questions raised while doubting the correctness of the larger bench decisions that is pending consideration before a three-Judges bench presided over by Hon'ble the Chief Justice.
6. In The Keshav Mills Co. Ltd., Petlad v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay North, Ahmedabad, AIR 1965 SC 1636, this Court held: ""When this Court decides questions of law, its decisions are, under Art. 141, binding on all Courts within the territory of India, and so, it must be the constant endeavour and concern of this Court to introduce and maintain an element of certainty and continuity in the interpretation of law in the country. Frequent exercise by this Court of its power to review its earlier decisions on the ground that the view pressed before it later appears to the Court to be more reasonable, may incidentally tend to make law uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently avoided.
That is not to say that if on a subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied that its earlier decision was clearly erroneous, it should hesitate to correct the error; but before a previous decision is pronounced to be plainly erroneous, the Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the said view is fully justified. It is not possible or desirable, and in any case it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles which should govern the approach of the Court in dealing with the question of reviewing and revising its earlier decisions. It would always depend upon several relevant considerations:-
What is the nature of the infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and revision of the earlier view is based? On the earlier occasion, did some patent aspects of the question remain unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not drawn to any relevant and material statutory provision, or was any previous decision of this Court bearing on the point not noticed? Is the Court hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is such an error in the earlier view? What would be the impact of the error on the general administration of law or on public good?
Has the earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either by this Court or by the High Court's? And, would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to public inconvenience, hardship or mischief? These and other relevant considerations must be carefully borne in mind whenever this Court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revise its earlier decisions. These considerations become still more significant when the earlier decision happens to be a unanimous decision of a Bench of five learned Judges of this Court.""
7. It is, therefore, evident that before making a reference to a larger Bench, the Court must reach a conclusion regarding the correctness of the judgment delivered by it previously, particularly that, which has been delivered by a Bench of nine Judges or more, and adjudge the effect of any error therein, upon the public, what inconvenience, hardship or mischief it would cause, and what the exact nature of the infirmity or error that warrants a review of such earlier judgments. In the instant case, we do not find any such compelling circumstance that may warrant a review, and thus, taking into consideration the facts of the present case, we are not convinced that this matter requires a reference to a larger Bench.
8. Before proceeding with the case, it is necessary to refer to certain relevant statutory provisions: It is evident from the Preamble of the Act, 1986 that the Lokayukta has two duties, firstly, to protect honest public functionaries from false complaints and allegations, and secondly, to investigate charges of corruption filed against public functionaries. Hence, investigation of such charges of corruption against public functionaries is not the only responsibility that the Lokayukta is entrusted with. Section 2(8) of the Act, 1986, defines the term, ""Public servant"", as having the same meaning, that has been given to it, under Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Section 3 (1) of the Act, 1986, reads as under:
""For the purpose of conducting investigations in accordance with provisions of this Act, the Governor shall, by warrant under his hand and seal, appoint a person to be known as the Lokayukta. Provided that the Lokayukta shall be appointed after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and except where such appointment is to be made at a time when the Legislative Assembly of the State of Gujarat has been dissolved or a Proclamation under Article 356 of the Constitution is in operation in the State of Gujarat, after consultation also with the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, or if there be no such Leader, a person elected in this behalf by the members of the Opposition in that House in such manner as the Speaker may direct.""
(Emphasis added)
Section 4 prescribes certain disabilities/disqualifications with respect to the appointment of the Lokayukta, and stipulates that he must not be a Member of Parliament or of any State Legislature, and also that he must not hold any office of trust, or profit and even if he does hold any such post, that he must tender his resignation as regards the same, before he is appointed as Lokayukta, and also further, that he must not be affiliated with any political party. Section 6 of the said Act, provides that the Lokayukta shall not be removed from office, except under an order made by the Governor, on the grounds of proven misbehaviour, or incapacity, after an inquiry into the same which has been conducted by the Chief Justice of the High Court of the State, or by a Judge nominated by him, in which, the Lokayukta is informed of the charges against him, and has been given, a reasonable opportunity of being heard, with respect to the same. Section 7 of the Act, 1986 provides for matters which may be investigated by the Lokayukta, against public functionaries, which may include the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers also. Section 12 of the Act, 1986 provides that the Lokayukta, after investigation of a complaint against the Chief Minister, if any substance is found therein, shall submit a written report, communicating the findings arrived at by him, along with such relevant materials/documents and other evidence, that are in his possession, to the Chief Minister himself.
Clause 2 thereof provides that, the Chief Minister shall then place the said report, without any delay, before the Council of Ministers. Section 19 of the Act, empowers the Governor to confer additional functions upon the Lokayukta, after having consultation with the Lokayukta, in relation to the eradication of corruption, which may be specified, by publishing a notification with respect to the same, in the Official Gazette. Section 20 of the Act, deals with the power to exclude complaints against certain classes of public functionaries. Under this Section, the State Government, upon a recommendation made by the Lokayukta, may exclude, by Notification in the Official Gazette, complaints involving allegations against persons belonging to a particular class of public functionaries, as has been specified in the said notification, from under the jurisdiction of the Lokayukta. CONSULTATION- means:
9. In State of Gujarat & Anr. v. Gujarat Revenue Tribunal Bar Association & Anr., JT 2012 (10) SC 422, this Court held that, the object of consultation is to render its process meaningful, so that it may serve its intended purpose. Consultation requires the meeting of minds between the parties that are involved in the consultative process, on the basis of material facts and points, in order to arrive at a correct, or at least a satisfactory solution. If a certain power can be exercised only after consultation, such consultation must be conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful. To ensure this, each party must disclose to the other, all relevant facts, for due deliberation.
The consultee must express his opinion only after complete consideration of the matter, on the basis of all the relevant facts and quintessence. Consultation may have different meanings in different situations, depending upon the nature and purpose of the statute. (See also: UOI v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth & Anr., AIR 1977 SC 2328; State of Kerala v. Smt. A. Lakshmikutty & Ors., AIR 1987 SC 331; High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan v. P.P Singh & Anr., AIR 2003 SC 1029; UOI & Ors. v. Kali Dass Batish & Anr., AIR 2006 SC 789; Andhra Bank v. Andhra Bank Officers & Anr., AIR 2008 SC 2936; and Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association, (2010) 11 SCC 1).
10. In Chandramouleshwar Prasad v. The Patna High Court & Ors., AIR 1970 SC 370, this Court held that, consultation or deliberation can neither be complete nor effective, before the parties thereto, make their respective points of view, known to the other, or others, and discuss and examine the relative merits of their views. If one party makes a proposal to the other, who has a counter proposal in mind, which is not communicated to the proposer, a direction issued to give effect to the counter proposal, without any further discussion with respect to such counter proposal, with the proposer cannot be said to have been issued after consultation.
11. In N. Kannadasan v. Ajoy Khose & Ors., (2009) 7 SCC 1, this Court considered a case regarding the appointment of the Chairman of a State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, and examined the communication between the consultant and consultee, i.e. the State Government and the Chief Justice of the High Court, and observed that, where the High Court had placed for consideration, certain material against a person, whose name was proposed by the State Government, for consideration with respect to his appointment to the post of Chairman of the State Commission, and no specific explanation was provided for the non- consideration of such material, then an appointment made in light of such circumstances, cannot be held to be an appointment made after due consultation.
The Court held as under: ""But, where a decision itself is thickly clouded by non- consideration of the most relevant and vital aspect, the ultimate appointment is vitiated not because the appointee is not desirable or otherwise, but because mandatory statutory requirement of consultation has not been rendered effectively and meaningfully"". Thus, in such a situation, even if a person so appointed was in theory, eligible for the purpose of being considered for appointment to the said post, the fact that the process of consultation was vitiated, would render the ultimate order of appointment vulnerable, and liable to questioning. In this case, this Court also considered its earlier decisions, in the cases of Ashish Handa, Advocate v. Hon'ble the Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab & Haryana & Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1308; and Ashok Tanwar & Anr. v. State of H.P. & Ors., AIR 2005 SC 614, and came to the conclusion that, the Chief Justice must send only one name, and not a panel of names for consideration, or else, the word 'primacy' would lose its significance.
If the Chief Justice sends a panel of names, and the Governor selects one from them, then it would obviously become the primacy of the Governor, and would not remain the primacy of the Chief Justice, which is the requirement under the law. The concept of primacy in such a situation, has been included, owing to the fact that, the Chief Justice of the High Court of the concerned State, is the most appropriate person to judge the suitability of a retired Judge, who will act as the Lokayukta and the object of the Act would not be served, if the final decision is left to the executive. The opinion of the Chief Justice would be entirely independent, and he would most certainly be in a position to determine who the most suitable candidate for appointment to the said office is. This Court has, therefore, explained that, the primacy of the opinion of the Chief Justice must be accepted, except for cogent reasons, and that the term consultation, for such purpose shall mean concurrence.
12. In N. Kannadasan (supra), while interpreting the provisions of Section 16 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, this Court held that, consultation under the said Act, cannot be equated with consultation, as contemplated by the Constitution under Article 217, in relation to the appointment of a Judge of the High Court. However, the Court further held, that primacy will be given to the opinion of the Chief Justice, where such consultation is statutorily required.
13. In Centre For PIL & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr., AIR 2011 SC 1267, this Court considered the argument of unanimity, or consensus, in the matter of the appointment of the Central Vigilance Commissioner and observed: ""It was further submitted that if unanimity is ruled out then the very purpose of inducting the Leader of the Opposition in the process of selection will stand defeated because if the recommendation of the Committee were to be arrived at by majority it would always exclude the Leader of the Opposition since the Prime Minister and the Home Minister will always be ad idem. xx xx xx We find no merit in these submissions. To accept the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners would mean conferment of a ""veto right"" on one of the members of the HPC. To confer such a power on one of the members would amount to judicial legislation.""
14. This Court, in Justice K.P. Mohapatra v. Sri Ram Chandra Nayak & Ors., AIR 2002 SC 3578, considered the provisions of Section 3(1)(a) of the Orissa Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 1995, which are pari materia with those of Section 3 of the Act, 1986. In the aforementioned case, the question that arose was with respect to the meaning of consultation, as contemplated under the Orissa Act, which is a verbatim replication of Section 3 of the Gujarat Act, and upon consideration of the statutory provisions of the Act, this Court came to the conclusion that:
""12. The investigation which Lokpal is required to carry out is that of quasi-judicial nature which would envisage not only knowledge of law, but also of the nature and work which is required to be discharged by an administrator. In this context, the word ""consultation"" used in Section 3(1) proviso (a) would require that consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court of Orissa is a must or a sine qua non. For such appointment, the Chief Justice of the High Court would be the best person for proposing and suggesting such person for being appointed as Lokpal. His opinion would be totally independent and he would be in a position to find out who is most or more suitable for the said office. In this context, primacy is required to be given to the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court. xx xx xx xx xx
16. Applying the principle enunciated in the aforesaid judgment, scheme of Section 3(1) of the Act read with the functions to be discharged by the Lokpal and the nature of his qualification, it is apparent that the consultation with the Chief Justice is mandatory and his opinion would have primacy."" (Emphasis added) The aforesaid appeal was filed against the judgment of the Orissa High Court in Ram Chandra Nayak v. State of Orissa, AIR 2002 Ori 25, wherein the High Court had held that the Governor, while appointing a person as Lokpal, must act upon the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and that there was no question of him exercising any power or discretion in his personal capacity. The said judgment was reversed by this Court on other grounds, but not on this issue.
15. In Indian Administrative Service (S.C.S.) Association, U.P. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., (1993) Supp.1 SCC 730, this Court explained the term `Consultation', though the same was done in the context of the promotion of certain officials under the provisions of the All India Services Act, 1951. The Court laid down various propositions with respect to consultation, inter-alia: ""(6) No hard and fast rule could be laid, no useful purpose would be served by formulating words or definitions, nor would it be appropriate to lay down the manner in which consultation must take place. It is for the Court to determine in each case in the light of its facts and circumstances whether the action is 'after consultation'; 'was, in fact, consulted' or was it a 'sufficient consultation'.""
16. Thus, in view of the above, the meaning of consultation varies from case to case, depending upon its fact-situation and the context of the statute, as well as the object it seeks to achieve. Thus, no straight-jacket formula can be laid down in this regard. Ordinarily, consultation means a free and fair discussion on a particular subject, revealing all material that the parties possess, in relation to each other, and then arriving at a decision. However, in a situation where one of the consultees has primacy of opinion under the statute, either specifically contained in a statutory provision, or by way of implication, consultation may mean concurrence. The court must examine the fact-situation in a given case to determine whether the process of consultation, as required under the particular situation did in fact, stand complete.
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GOVERNOR ACTS:
17. In Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr., AIR 1974 SC 2192, this Court expounded the universal rule that, the Governor is bound to act only in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister. The Rules of Business and allocation of business among the Ministers, related to the provisions of Article 53 in the case of the President, and Article 154 in the case of the Governor, state that executive power in connection with the same, shall be exercised by the President or the Governor either directly, or through subordinate officers. The President is the formal or Constitutional head of the Executive. The real executive powers, however, are vested in the Ministers of the Cabinet.
Wherever the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the President or the Governor, for the purpose of exercise by the Presid",1
