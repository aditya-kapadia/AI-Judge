Civil cases are to be decided on the basis of preponderance of probabilities of evidence, whereas criminal cases are to be decided on the basis of proving the guilt beyond reasonable doubts. In view of ratio of laid down in Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr vs. Meenakshi Marwah and Anr. (2005) 4 SCC 370, both civil and criminal cases can go simultaneously. [4]. In view of above, there is no error of jurisdiction committed by the trial Court. This revision petition is accordingly dismissed.
